The demand for skilled drone pilots is expanding rapidly across various industries and now even the taxi sector is jumping on board.     


The similarity between the flight controllers of these vehicles and video game controllers is becoming more evident each day. Interestingly, there's a deeper connection between drone technology and piloting flying cars compared to traditional airplane flight training. The skills and expertise gained from drone piloting provide a unique advantage in mastering the controls of these futuristic vehicles.

This advantage extends particularly to the younger generations, such as Gen Z and possibly even Gen Alpha. With their decade-long experience using gaming controls and honed hand-to-screen coordination, they are well-positioned to excel in this emerging field.

Quiet, clean, convenient, everything a Smartcity wants.



I’ve always been curious about smart cities, and how technology is yet to be used to its full advantage. [https://quantumcybersec.substack.com/p/building-the-city-of-the-future-how?sd=pf](https://quantumcybersec.substack.com/p/building-the-city-of-the-future-how?sd=pf)

Cybercrime, though, seems inevitable with smart cities. What productive steps could be taken to limit that?





Does any of you have heard of this technology?

I'm currently looking for the price range but i can't find anything online.

I couldn't find a sub for non-indoor air monitoring, so don't be afraid to refer me elsewhere!
Hi, I am in the process of looking for interview candidates for my master's dissertation which is looking at the integration of historic buildings with smart city sectors. Specifically, I need a candidate who is UK based, working in the built environment or with smart city technology and is willing to give up 15 minutes of their time. 

The result of the interview will be written out in transcript and the interviewee will remain anonymous. If there  is anybody willing to help please contact me on this post. Thanks!







hi there, I'm Cate, a tech mobility journo in Berlin. I'm visiting San Fran this week and just wanted to see if anyone was working on anything particularly interesting that might be worth an article? Feel free to message me.

As much technology as we invent it ultimately lies with us as people to truly make a smart city successful.






I'm curious to know what forms of technologies are being implemented to improve and/or increase cyclist witin cities. 

&#x200B;

A few things which I found already in Denmark are as follows; 

* A network of cycle lanes, **separated from motorized (cars) traffic** \[Basics of a cycling infrastructure\]
* The **Cycle Super Highways,**  a safe, fast,  and comfortable way of biking. A network with over **300km of cycle lanes \[**[Source: PDF](https://www.regionh.dk/english/traffic/cycling/Documents/CycleSuperHighwaysENDELIG2.pdf)\]
* **Green Wave\*\*\*\*****^(1)** for cyclists; As long as cyclists continue biking as a speed, they will be granted green light at an intersection. So they don't have to stop cycling \[[Source: Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfMp42fS4QU)\]
* Introduction of  **variable message signs**  for cyclists - signs can display information about congestion on the bike track ahead,  travel times, events, road works etc etc... \[[Souce: Web 1](https://ecf.com/news-and-events/news/smarter-cycling-series-city-copenhagen-introduces-variable-message-signs-%E2%80%93)\]
* **20 seconds Extra time** (green traffic lights for bikers)  to cycle when it's raining \[[Source: Web 2](https://ramboll.com/ingenuity/how-its-and-technology-can-accelerate-making-cycling-about-people)\]
* Right turn Warning signs/(slow down) for motorized vehicles – warming them of bikers ahead \[Source: Previous URL\]
* The city of Aarhus Uses **RFID chips** (in bicycles) for Traffic Control \[[Source: Web3](https://www.rfid-wiot-search.com/solution-search/cycling-aarhus-uses-rfid-for-traffic-control)\] \[[Youtybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS2sEP0HTkU)\]
* I loved this one (not tech-related but) Denmark Trains Provide Bike Seats! \[[Source:Photo](https://denmark.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/Bike_Place_in_Train-min.jpg)\]

 Hello Everyone ! 😊

I'm conducting a survey on the **energy transition** of a country and its impact ont its internationalization for my Master Thesis in International Business.

[https://forms.gle/SV7Cv6Epou6Bdsm78](https://forms.gle/SV7Cv6Epou6Bdsm78)

The purpose of this research will be to understand how **smart city** models can answer the need for **urban development** by measuring the influence of its green energies and smart technologies. I would like to thank you in advance for your precious time and contribution to this project !
Hope this is allowed, posting in case this postdoctoral researcher job is of interest to anyone here!

In the not-too-distant future, we will have systems that offer new  kinds of transport services with new kinds of semi-autonomous or  fully-autonomous shared vehicles. How can we better understand the  present issues in transport to plan for our future within these systems?  How can we make sure that these technologies are human-centred, driven  by the needs of our real and rapidly evolving lives?   

We  are looking for creative and innovative problem solvers to help us  build better, more sustainable ways for all of us to get to work, to  school, to home, in ways that keep us healthier and happier in the time  we spend in transit. This could mean the flexible integration of several  modes of transport, whether this is cycling, walking, a ride sharing  service, or a flexible shuttle bus service, taking account of personal  preferences and constraints.    

This research into  sustainable transport solutions is part of the AutoTrust project – a  collaboration between the University of Southampton and the University  of Warwick – which is researching how to design, build, and sustain  trustworthy human-centric smart transport systems that leverage advances  in technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicles and the  Internet of Things.  

Based in Southampton, you will assist with a  research project into transport patterns and preferences among  University staff and students, as a precursor to identifying and  developing interventions that can enable and encourage more  environmentally-friendly transport practices post-COVID.  

Imagine  a mapping tool that helps us understand the routes and numbers of  people who feel they cannot take public transportation because they  cannot take their children to school in the morning. If that is a real  issue, how could emerging technologies be harnessed to support that  scenario (in some countries a school bus manages that challenge)?  Applicants should also consider the work to date on the Time Travel  project.  

There is flexibility in the proposed research  plan, and so your input to inform and refine the research questions and  study design would be welcomed based on your own research expertise and  interests. We are particularly keen to combine agent-based modelling  with Grounded Theory of the factors that affect the acceptability of  public transport to all its stakeholders. Please take on board the  scenario above when responding to this advert, look at the TimeTravel  Project site, and share your vision with us. We will expect applicants  to be able to articulate their research plans, and to explain how that  research will contribute to scientific knowledge. 

The  successful candidate will be required to have a PhD or equivalent  professional qualifications and experience in computer science,  human-computer interaction, simulation/modelling, transportation, or a  similar discipline. You will also need to demonstrate your ability to  publish in scientific venues.  

The AutoTrust project also  aims to help develop the skills and expertise of future “super  researchers” and so you will be working in an interdisciplinary team,  with other academics, industry, and policymakers. The project provides  training and development opportunities to help you develop relevant  skills and build your own research network.  

We are particularly keen to encourage applicants from under-represented groups in Computer Science.   

We’d  be pleased to discuss potential research directions prior to  application, and if you wish to do so, please contact Dr Richard Gomer,  r.gomer@soton.ac.uk   

More information about our research can be found on the project website at https://autotrust.org.uk/

Dear reddit community,

Imagine a “smart city transport”, where the bus is “coordinated” (regarding it’s time, stops, etc.) with not only for example the underground, but also bike lanes, e-scooter borrowing places, and so on. Which other “activities” regarding transport should be included in this “smart city transport” coordination? So far, we have come up with buses, trains, the underground, e-scooters, trams, and bikes/bike lanes. 

Any comments and ideas would be highly appreciated, as it would greatly help us with our university project! If you have any questions in regard to our project, we are happy to discuss them with you.
The small port commune of Savona in Italy is an example of an up-and-coming smart city and proof that technology isn't exclusively reserved for metropolitan areas.  
Aside from introducing all-electric buses as means of public transportation, the city is on the course to adopt the express all-electric bus lane. The only downside is that it requires the conversion of parking spots alongside the main road into the said lane.

Enel X that's powering the project estimates 3.4 million euros of savings per year on a sample of 100 electric buses that would replace the old diesel units. Furthermore, there's a potential for up to 40% reduction of energy consumption with additional investments in smart bus depot systems.  
Now, imagine what can be achieved in large hubs if something similar was to be introduced instead of doing it in a small town with 60,000 inhabitants!

I'm a data engineer with several years of experience. Since some time I'm interested in urbanization and smart cities (more in terms of safe data, sustainability, resource management, transportation etc). I would like to pursue a phd in combination of my work experience (Big Data, software engineering) and interests (urbanization and what I have mentioned earlier). 

I'm living in Europe, so it is my natural choice for phd opportunities. 

Do you know any European universities conducting a research in these topics?

It seems like the Smart City Decision makers vary quite a bit from location to location.

In his speech at TED talk in 2015 Michael Green defines smart city as design and technology integrated into the urban fabric itself.

According to one study by STANTEC INC. in this [video](https://youtu.be/gCfQNVaabUc) smart programs also generate economic and financial gains that not only cover the cost of investment, but also provide tangible returns. The sample consisted of huge number of cities engaged in smart city initiatives to be specific 100 cities around the world. Study also reveals some actual numbers for Return of Investment. Here are the list of sectors providing the largest gains:

1. Public safety with first aid alerts having 5.6% return, gunshot sensors with 4.8%, and real time crime mapping with 4.7%. Totaling to a 15.1% of return
2. Governance with digital business licensing leading with 5% of return and digital payments with 4.6%. Totaling to a 9.6% of return
3. Energy and water sector comes in third with dynamic electricity pricing having 4.8% return rate and renewable energy with 4.3%. Totaling to a 9.1%
4. Mobility and Transportation is 4th and totals to a 8.8%. curb management having 4.5%
5. The last but not the least is environment sector with optimizing waste collection having 4.1% return and real-time water quality monitoring with 3.9%. Total of 8% return rate.

Considering this and many other factors described in the [video](https://youtu.be/gCfQNVaabUc), what is its future potential and real-world application? To get answers and to know more about smart cities watch this comprehensive [video](https://youtu.be/gCfQNVaabUc) about smart cities.
For the last year and a half I've been working in an open source tool that enables easy simulation of real cities. Note that source data is a major issue, that's why results may not be even close to reality but interesting enough to see it working. 

Here's the github repo: [https://github.com/EpsilonZ/CityVisualizer](https://github.com/EpsilonZ/CityVisualizer)

Here's a sample visualization of what this visualizer can do (it can scale up to 500k and, with a set of optimizations can get up to 1KK): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UivN9joTPaI&t=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UivN9joTPaI&t=)

What's also great about this is that it generates a huge dataset as we had monitored everyone, therefore we can apply AI with that huge quantity of data (but that's just an idea as AI is not something that I master).  


Note that I'm still working on it though so any sugestions are welcome even if you aren't developer!

Hi guys

Just wondering how telecommuting/or remote work will shape cities in the future? E.g less traffic, less office buildings maybe?



So this question is the subject of my uni class research but honestly, I have no idea where to start. The internet (telecom companies) seems the most essential infrastructure required for smart cities to operate but then again IoT infrastructure is the real enabler. But I was curious in the most open way, what the community (with more advanced knowledge than I) thinks about the key industries/companies to enable smart cities!
Ps. This is a finance/business class!




Hellooo,

So,I would basically like to know if some of you could lead me into this topic. I would like to know about good sources and investigators / foundations that are good authorities on what are the biggest threats and challenges to the advancement of smart cities right now. 

Also,I am all hears to your opinions about this topic.

Thank you all in advance,
I found several collections, but there are mostly people from companies involved in smart cities. but it is interesting to me to read and see the reviews from real bloggers.

hi all, I have researched heavily into the main smart cities eg singapore, dubai, san diego. I am doing a college project and apart from the tecnology that these cities are currently using is there any up and coming technology that could be implemented in the next 5 years to improve theses cities. if anyone has any suggestions or links to new concepts i would greatly appreciate it.

What do we need to have a better environment in buildings? What do we need to do to get more from buildings? Most of the time we have complaints like:

It is hot in here
It is too cold inside
Why are the lights left open
It is too bright in here
We have invested a lot to have a smart building but now the air is not fresh in the office
We think the most important issue is that we don't know how we use the buildings and we don't get enough data from our buildings to understand what is happening in our buildings. We think that the buildings are concrete structures and will never change from day 1 to eternity. But is that the real case?
What we saw during our work and study cases for the last 5 years is that buildings are living ecosystems like we are. They wake up, they live the day and they sleep. They breathe, they feel overcrowded they need to be listened to. That can be done only by listening to the data which they produce during the day. We can have the best technology in our building, we can have the latest HVAC systems but as long as we don't follow or get data from multiple points of the building and understand that data we won't make our buildings comfortable and efficient. We have to stop making assumptions of how the set points of HVAC should be or pre-schedule the systems according to calculations which are done before life starts at those buildings.

About one-third of all commercial HVAC units are too big for the spaces they serve — often resulting in excessive energy costs that seriously impact a building’s financial performance. HVAC systems are disconnected from the building.
Approximately 10%–40% of the energy can be saved if the occupants’ presence/absence is factored into the building operation based on a dozen different case studies conducted in commercial buildings.

Our actions, our behavior and the way we use buildings effects energy consumption in those buildings. Occupant presence and behavior in buildings have a significant impact on space heating, cooling and ventilation demand, energy consumption of lighting and appliances, and building controls.

Occupancy (presence and number of occupants) is one of the most important factors impacting the energy efficiency of HVAC systems as occupancy determines heating/cooling loads on the demand side by varying conditioning periods and settings.
Result:

1- Support your building with data which is produced from different parts of the building.

2- Don't rely only on one kind of sensors. Use different sensors throughout your building.

3- Use systems that have open APIs and which support 3rd party interaction.

4- Digitalization is the next oil. Digitize your building portfolio.



I'd love to seem more discussion between the Smart City communities and the Open Government communities.  Thought I would post a link to the opengov subreddit to help encourage that more [https://www.reddit.com/r/opengov/](https://www.reddit.com/r/opengov/)

Hi there,

&#x200B;

I'm looking for Smartcity Usecases, mainly around technology and data, that are beyond the typical waste level, smart metering, realtime transport.

Specifically in terms of machine learning. How can multiple data sources be combined to create value (e.g. smart traffic + smart parking + events), how is machine learning applied in actual real world (city) usecases, and the like.  


Does anyone have some input?

Hey guys, just wondering how active this sub is. Anyone around to talk smart cities? I am an architecture student & for our thesis year we are studying Union Point, MA & smart cities in general. I guess ill just ask a question to give you guys something to answer. 

&nbsp;


What is a smart city? What are the pros and cons?

&nbsp;


Here is a video my professor gave us -  &nbsp;

I can't tell you the number of times I sit at an intersection waiting for lights to change. with all the high tech available to us, can't we have much smarter intersections that minimize waiting times (and air pollution)? thanks for your thoughts!





these have been super helpful for me in understanding the levels of a city's evolution. here's the link to the newest responsive cities course: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ETHx+FC-04x+3T2017/course/








Hi there! 
This is my first time using reddit. I'm currently a student doing my senior thesis topic on the security and IoT. I have questions about security such as:

How would the infrastructure would look like for a smart city. 
What will the platform look like?
What types of security implement will we need in order to protect a city?
How can we protect smart cities from getting breach? 
Who will run this security? 
What types of standardization will we need for security in IoT in the future? 

Any help will be appreciated it! 
If anyone is an expert in the field of security, I would love to do a video or phone interview with you.
That would be really helpful for me in understand the vulnerablities in security in IoT better. 






Hi everyone, Civic Tech TO and Connected Lab needs your input on an exciting project.

Wild Combination is a rapid ideation activity where participants draw a Scenario, a Technology, and User card and creatively solve for the combination with a product, feature or service idea. It looks like a game but it serves an important function. At Connected lab we use this as a tool to encourage discussion, facilitate ideation, and energize brainstorming sessions. It helps you get 'unstuck'. It can also be used as an educational tool.

Civic Tech Toronto and Connected Lab are designing, validating, and ultimately printing a set of cards for an interactive exhibition at the Design Exchange and UN Development Program's EDIT Expo: Prosperity For All. Our theme is Shelter/Cities. Help us bring a civic voice to EDIT!

Please fill in any or all of the fields below if you have a User, Technology or Scenario that you want to submit. Users can be anyone in the city; a municipal worker, a policy maker, or a citizen etc. The technology cards could be any technology that might reasonably become a part of a civic tech solution. Lastly, for scenarios, you can think of any potential challenge or problem that a city might face.

You don't need to fill out all of the fields and you can submit as many times as you like.

Thanks a lot in advance for your participation! We will be offering the cards for free as a downloadable file, I will share it will you guys when we're done!

Hey everyone.

I recently started using IRC again in hope of finding some real-time discussions and networks occupied with the concept of Smart Cities and/or Open- and Big Data. 

Does such a thing exist? Do you know of any networks using the IRC medium to discuss these topics?







Here are just a few tumblr blogs focussed on smart cities:

Ericsson has a whole series of films on their YouTube channel exploring the 'networked society' - check them out.
In most cities today, urban development is decided at a governmental level rather then by those who live in it: the citizens. Rossant believes this could be the number one reason for the shortcomings of cities, and suggests that a people-centric approach is needed. Thoughts?

For centuries, farmers have grown produce with soil, sunlight, and water. A new farm, called Bowery, says it has found a much more efficient place to grow: inside a giant warehouse in Kearny, New Jersey. Fain, a former marketing entrepreneur, says Bowery’s name comes from the old Dutch word for farm: “Bouwerij.” The first colonizers of Manhattan’s Bowery neighborhood, families of freed slaves in the 1600s, also built large farms there. “They fed the city,” he says.

It’s a vertical farm where everything grows indoors under **LEDs that mimic natural sunlight**. Instead of soil, crops sprout in **nutrient\-rich water beds on trays stacked from the floor to the ceiling**. Currently, Bowery is testing over 80 different varieties of greens, including baby kale, mustard greens, and arugula.

Fain says that the farm’s operational costs stay low because of a proprietary piece of **software**, called FarmOS, that is constantly searching for ways to make the growing process more efficient. For instance, if Bowery finds a batch of romaine needs a different intensity of light or a cooler atmosphere, it can **change the conditions in the warehouse using FarmOS**.

Part of the farm’s efficiency comes from the fact that the growing trays are stacked five to the ceiling and arranged in tight rows. The farm is also able to produce greens **year\-round**.

# Pros 

* Increased production;
* No need for pesticides \(improving crops and reducing pollution\);
* Fresh delivery;
* Reduce waste;
* Water use – in hydroponic systems water is re\-used, cutting water waste by perhaps up to 98&#37;;
* No deforestation for new farms – obviously vertical farms are mostly in urban areas re\-using buildings;
* Reduce or eliminate long delivery chains;
* Reduced fossil fuel use.

# Cons

* If using artificial lighting, high energy use;
* More costly greens;
* High setup cost;
* Harder to find experienced growers.

# Effects

1. More efficiency –\>  improved customer satisfaction and quality of production

2. Less water usage and fossil fuel use \+ no deforestation –\> reduced carbon footprint

3. Tackling the problem of climate change

# Costs

**Footprint:** 150 m

**Initial cost for the ZipFarm™:** $110k \(not including upgrades to the facility\)

Lighting costs represent the highest ongoing expense for the ZipFarm.

In the example shown here, we are using 48 LED lighting units, each running at 355 watts.

48 lighting units

355 watts each to operate

18 hours of daily lighting

Total = 306.72 kWh daily

In 2016, the national average for commercial energy was 10.37c/kWh. Residential energy rates averaged 12.56c/kWh.

This means that the daily cost for electricity is $31.80 \(commercial\) and $38.52 \(residential\).

306.72 kWh x $0.1037/kWh = $31.80 daily

306.72 kWh x $0.1256/kWh = $38.52 daily

# Conclusions

Organic farming was an evolution from industrialized farming. It strived for sustainability, enhancement of soil fertility and biological diversity, but when the standards for organic farming were set, most of today\`s technology did not yet exist. Indoor vertical farming is the evolution from organic farming. It can solve issues like access to high quality fresh food in urban areas done more efficiently – a problem for almost every city in the world. 


SUEZ implements so called “Viso Piloting centres”, which are for water and waste water treatment, conducted in different territories. This centres keep a daily watch onto hundreds of sides regarding to the ground water level to be sure water is on the right place. This is important for the general understanding of the development and accessibility of water. In addition to that the company is able to determine risks of flooding to take action in time.

Furthermore, and more interesting for the individual household, SUEZ is monitoring the water pressure and the quality of the water in the water\-networks. In connecting the water network to the *Viso Piloting centres*, it is possible to determine problems like leaks in the water management network.

Google maps is a perfect tool for navigating with car in the cities. But there is not enough information for walking routes, cycling routes and not information at all about wheelchair accessibility. If maps like that are accessible that will change the image of the city.

Lagos' approach to smart cities involves a high level of participation among its residents. People are able to monitor the development through social media, where citizens can update government officials in charge of the projects latest development without these officials having to be on the site itself.

Most places on earth are designed in a car orientated way. A smart solution to work against the car dominance in cities is the example of the Broadway Boulevard. Streets were congested by cars and pedestrians had to move along the too little sidewalks. This problem was solved not in creating more or wider roads, instead the road was closed of to serve its space for Manhatten's pedestrians. Closing of a highly congested road and creating more public space instead is a smart way to make a city more liveable and improve the quality of life. This change also contributes in changing peoples mind sets towards the use of car, since they are forced to rethink their way to commute.

# Logistics

Logistics can be defined as efficient and cost\-effective managerial decisions related to the design, planning and control of the supply chain processes. The most popular concept pf Logistics Management is the concept of the 7 Rs: it is concerned with getting the **right product**, in the** right quantit**y, in the** right conditio**n, at the** right plac**e, at the** right tim**e to the** right custome**r and at the** right pric**e. 

# Smart Logistics

Smart Logistics approaches this in a smart way, which means that **planning and scheduling**, **ICT infrastructure**, **people** and **governmental policymaking** need to be efficiently and effectively **aligned**. Smart Logistics equals **3P\+I** \(i.e. Planning, People, Policy and Infrastructure\), and is the synchronized interplay of these four key domains.

# Smart Warehouse

A smart warehouse is the culmination of warehouse automation \(in other words, **automating various components of your warehousing operations**\). A smart warehouse is enabled with several automated and interconnected technologies. These technologies work together to increase the productivity and efficiency of the warehouse, minimizing the amount of human workers while decreasing errors.

As Royce Digital explains, “In manual warehouses, we usually saw workers moving around with lists, picking products, loading them into carts and then delivering them to the shipping docks,” but in smart warehousing, “**Orders are received automatically**, after which the **system confirms if the products are in stock**. The pick\-up lists are then sent **to robot\-carts that place the ordered products into containers** and deliver them to workers for the next step.”

# Components of Smart Warehouse Systems

https://preview.redd.it/ehdld89booz01.jpg?width=2812&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54aedc0d66d46ceb93b21bf22ae5098f1ed61a1f

· **The Internet of Things:**

IoT involves several internet\-enabled devices communicating with each other and sharing data. An example of IoT at work in a smart warehouse system starts from a **warehouse receiving a product**. As the shipment is received, a** RFID scanner scans the tag**s, telling a** WMS which and how many goods were receive**d. The WMS then communicates with** robots, informing them of where those goods should be store**d on the warehouse floor.

· **Radio\-frequency identification \(RFID\):**

RFID involves placing a **digital tag** on goods and packages that come into a warehouse, **replacing paper labels**. Radio waves are then used to transfer data to or between the digital tag and an automated scanning system, recording the product’s information.

· **Warehouse Management Systems:**

The use of a WMS is the cherry on top of all of your smart technology. These **software solutions help you collect, manage and view all kinds of data about your warehouse operations**. This allows you to keep track of how efficient your warehouse’s day\-to\-day operations are running.

· **Robotics:**

Warehousing robots **automate the picking process by physically bringing product shelves to the human workers packing orders**. Essentially, they’re automated, more maneuverable pallet jacks. They move faster than people can, move more goods at once and they can even identify the optimal route for picking up the necessary goods.

· **Artificial Intelligence:**

AI helps warehousing **robots find the most efficient route for picking products**. It can also be used to **determine the best size box for a shipment based on the type, number, size and weight of the products**. Some warehouses have even been able to implement machines that can pack products, using AI to pack them in the most space\-efficient manner.

# Pros 

* More automation means **fewer humans in the warehouse**. Robots don’t have **sick days or holidays** and can work all day and night **without a break**
* Automated systems working together can accomplish tasks **faster than human beings**
* Health and safety **risks reduced** significantly

# Cons

* **High initial costs** prevent many warehouse operators from implementing automated systems
* Warehouse layouts and processes need to be **changed to accommodate the new machinery and systems**
* **New skills and expertise** are required to implement and maintain the systems
* Breakdowns can be very costly in terms of **repair costs and downtime**
* With a highly\-automated warehouse, a **software glitch could cause the whole operation to stop**

# Effects

1. More **efficiency** \-\> better **economic development** & improve**d customer satisfacti**on 

2. Less working hours \-\> **reduced energy use** **\+ no fu**el for forklifts

3. **Reduced injuries** and claims

4. Less labor \-\> lower product prices \-\> more appealing prices \+ **more demand** \-\>** pay higher **w**ages \+ hire more** people

5. Automation \-\> **new types of jobs** \(AI,ICT\)

# Costs

In Amazon UK – 2,500 robots controlled by a central server – **80m pounds**. 

One ‘old school’ robot costs approximately **1000 dollars**. 

# Conclusions

We **should not be afraid** of new technological inventions, because it will open **new fields to discover** and work in. 
A carbon tax is a tax levied on the carbon content of fuels. It is a form of carbon pricing. Revenue obtained via the tax is however not \(always\) used to compensate the carbon emissions on which the tax is levied. 

Carbon tax offers social and economic benefits. It is a tax that **increases revenue without significantly altering the economy** while simultaneously **promoting objectives of climate change** **policy**. The objective of a carbon tax is to reduce the harmful and unfavorable levels of carbon dioxide emissions, thereby decelerating climate change and its negative effects on the environment and human health.

# Pros

1. Promotes solving the issue of **climate change**;
2. **Cost\-effective** means to reduce the production of the greenhouse gas;
3. **Tax revenues** may be used to favor low\-income groups and can be used for mitigating the effects of pollution.

# Cons

1. Companies may **relocate** to countries without the carbon tax;
2. People might **lose their jobs**;
3. **Expensive** administration cost.

# Effects

1. **Higher price** of carbon emissions \-\> encourages **the usage and invention of alternatives** to the existing polluting vehicles

2. Firms using **alternatives** \-\> producing **less pollution** \-\> improves th**e environme**nt

3. Introducing carbon tax \-\> **making people aware** of the problem and how carbon emissions can harm the world and the business

# Cost

For carbon tax to be really expensive, the government **would need a huge amount of money to implement it**. If more funds are available at their disposal, implementation would not be a problem. If this is not the case, then the rule would be ineffective, especially because **it requires money to ensure carbon tax is functioning properly**. 

Aside from this, it is often difficult to determine the actual external cost and the amount of tax that must be imposed. This requires more time, effort and money.

# Conclusions

Perhaps the answer of pro or anti carbon tax would depend on who you are asking. **Companies that will be greatly affected** by it will always look **at tax as a bane**, while **environmentalists** will view it as a **boon**.

What other pros and cons can you suggest? Are you in favor of rewarding schemes or taxation schemes?



- Remote readings of the meter for the users and the company. 
- Control other equipment in the house with the meter.
- More insight in to your own energy consumption which makes people more aware and can lead to less consumption. 
- People will be able to read their final transactions. And companies can give tips to save money. 

- Final transactions are more reliable. 

- There is a connection possible with for example solar panels and micro cogeneration. 
- There will be a detailed insight into financial conecuenses. 

- But there is also the possibility privacy violations.
- The mater itself uses energy and it hackable.

A desire path is a path created as a consequence of erosion caused by human or animal foot-fall or traffic. The path usually represents the shortest or most easily navigated route between an origin and destination. Width and erosion severity can be indicators of how much traffic a path receives.

We've all heard how Amsterdam is the pinnacle of bicycle infrastructure and the leading example of how to design bike centered infrastructure. After living here for about a year I can definitely say that should not be the case.

While the Netherlands in general have really nice spaces and lanes for their bicycles, biking around the capital is a scary, uncomfortable and confusing experience.

I moved here from Copenhagen seeking a city where I could feel just as comfortable getting around but the reality is that the same sort of isolated bike path network that works so well in the rest of the country, is just not very well designed around the city centre, with paths often stopping in the middle of nowhere, leaving you directly in the middle of the road or sidewalk, and the directions they take being inorganic often leading to someone not familiar with the area missing their turn or swing and suddenly driving in the wrong direction. The paths can also never decide whether both directions should be on each side of the road or on just one side. So suddenly you are driving on the road while both paths are on the opposite side.

Adding to all this, a lot of the paths are getting old and worn down, and often you need to drive on roots sticking out of the ground and randomly steep bridges.

Does anyone else who has moved to Amsterdam or live here feel the same way? Cause I was really surprised that it was that much worse to bike in central (and adjacent) Amsterdam than it is in Copenhagen or even elsewhere in the Netherlands. Especially after hearing a lot of urban designers claiming the opposite.
A bit of a tactical ~~urbanism~~ moderation trial to help concentrate common questions around career and education advice.

**The current soft trial will:**

\- To the extent possible, refer users posting these threads to the scheduled posts.

\- Test the waters for aggregating this sort of discussion

\- Take feedback (in this thread) about whether this is useful

**If it goes well:**

\- We would add a formal rule to direct conversation about education or career advice to these threads

\- Ask users to help direct users to these threads

**Goal:**

To reduce the number of posts asking somewhat similar questions about Education or Career advice and to make the previous discussions more readily accessible.


Why is it that Japanese convenience stores (and stores in general) are so much more common and evenly distributed across the land compared to the US?
In Ontario Canada, there is a greenbelt that surrounds the country's largest city. It is made up of class 1 farmland, forests, wetlands and endangered species. Yet the current government decided to open up the land to a few big developers. There was corruption found in the decision and the govt just will not return the land. It is honestly disheartening and makes zero sense as there is a yellow belt full of aging and decaying subdivisions.

When you think about progressive urban planning and decent rail service Florida is not the first place that comes to mind. With sprawling cities and whatnots, you don’t really think of Florida as a model for good urban planning. For these reasons I would have never thought or expected for a project of that magnitude to be ever completed in the Sunshine State. Nevertheless it did, and it has been an astounding [success](https://www.hsrail.org/brightline-florida/).  Florida loves Brightline. They started seeing the benefit of intercity train travel. TODs have started [flourishing](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2023/07/30/orlandos-brightline-station-is-only-the-beginning-commentary/) near Palm Beach to the Miami-Dade region. If this can happen in Florida imagine the progress that could be done in similar states, and imagine the progress of states that already have the infrastructure! In my opinion America’s future is definitely bright (no pun intended lol).


I see this sub talk about the most walkable cities a lot, but I’m more interested in a neighborhood by neighborhood scale. What are some of the most walkable neighborhoods in the United States?

My suburb in melbourne, Australia builds these wide paths for bikes and people but they’re so inconvenient. And they build them in the most unsafe places(directly next to the road). What happens is that pedestrians don’t wanna walk because its like right next to a road with cars going above 60 km/h. They’re designed for ppl to travel along their left side but everyone ends up going on the lane that’s furthest from the road. 

Bicycle riders can’t go at an efficient speed and they have to loop around ppl increasing the risk of swerving to the road. In the future when my suburb becomes fully developed and ppl have to actually use the paths, there won’t be room for bike riders. And in places where the areas already busy, families are always standing on the shared paths with their strollers, walking with their dogs or blocking the paths with their car doors. In the end, theres no safe path for bicycle riders.

The least my council can do is build bollards or widen the paths even more and place them further from the road. In certain paths they’ve tried separating the shared path and road with bushes but this “protection” lasts 10m before being next to a car.
So I know rent control by and large is accepted as a pretty crappy policy that does nothing to address housing affordability in the long term. From what I understand, the main (and probably only) benefit of rent control is to protect current residents from displacement. So I’m trying to think of a specific scenario where rent control would be a good thing to do. Here’s what I’m thinking: 

Say for example a neighbourhood/area/district was being actively gentrified. New “””luxury””” housing is being built and investments are being made in infrastructure. All of these things are good (improved infrastructure, new housing, revitalization, etc) EXCEPT land values will subsequently increase to the degree that existing residents will be displaced due to not being able to afford living there anymore. This is the primary downside of gentrification as I understand it. In this instance, wouldn’t rent control be a very beneficial policy to implement in this specific instance? You could essentially apply rent control to the existing housing stock in the immediate area to protect existing residents, and then leave the new housing stock as is. I guess then the main question would be, for how long is that rent control in effect for? I don’t know. 

Since the main problem with rent control is that it constrains supply, wouldn’t it be useful in these specific scenarios, when used in tandem with other policies and incentive programs that will concurrently bolster the production of new supply? 

In what other scenarios is rent control a good thing? Does this make sense? I’m sure there are many other factors that would make the scenario I described a lot more complex.
Do the ends justify the means? Canadian provinces are making significant changes to planning legislation in an attempt to address the housing crisis. For context I am from Ontario and did school there, but live and work in BC and am curious for others thoughts.
I live in a pretty bike unfriendly place. There's a disconnected painted bike lane network, but no protected infrastructure and some of the most dangerous streets for cyclists have no dedicated bike lane (even a narrow painted one) at all. 

Speaking from my own personal experience, it's been safer to simply take the sidewalk. Yes, this is far from ideal, but when the alternative is being flattened by a lifted pick up, the odd annoyed pedestrian seems like a clear winner. I've noticed however that electric scooters are often far better for sidewalk riding. More maneuverable because they're smaller and more light weight, making them easier to pass pedestrians on narrow sidewalks.

Should bike unfriendly places promote more e-scooters to switch people from cars, trying to promote safe riding on sidewalks, at the least as a stop gap measure before the funds and political will for more dedicated bike/micro mobility lanes builds up?

a few months ago i got super into urban planning after moving to a terribly designed city (tampa). i moved back to milwaukee and can appreciate the city so much more now

any resources to learn more or opportunities to get involved with urban planning, public transit, or architecture in milwaukee? volunteering, events, local authors, places i should check out ect
I'm curious how these housing options stack up in terms of speed in getting built and on the market. Lets take for example an apartment building with 200 units, and 200 (or maybe less if they're large) single family houses. For the sake of this we'll ignore other factors like length of time spent in design and approvals and whatnot. Take both examples and start construction on the same day. Which set of housing units gets finished first? I'm having trouble finding data on this so I thought I'd ask here.

The single family homes probably introduce a unique complexity to the thought experiment, since you could technically argue that building one apartment building is slower than building 200 houses simultaneously. Given supply of labour and materials, however, I doubt a given subdivision would have 200 houses under construction simultaneously (maybe I'm wrong though) For the sake of this we could assume that the number of houses being built at one time is the average for a typical new suburban development.
(I'm American for context)

I used to be really interested in cities across the United States and while I still am, I can't help but feel that majoring in urban planning might not have been a good idea at all. I never knew until I took classes at my college and just how badly American cities are structured around racism, capitalism, and car-centric development. Now I can't unsee any of it. Of course change is possible but this change is going to take years, if not decades due to politics.

And now with urban planning circulating on platforms like TikTok and YouTube, American urban planners are roasted and mocked by people who want more walkable cities and better public transportation. For instance, I love Not Just Bikes' perspectives on urban planning but not a video goes by where he disproves of the work American urban planners do. It feels so toxic and hopeless. Does anyone else feel this way or could offer insight?


I know there are lists of urban planning blogs, but I want a big list, not just the 'best' (i.e. most well-funded) blogs/orgs, and I want to know all the blogs/voice in my community, which is at the moment, roughly speaking, Atlanta.

I'm interested in any/all voices in/around Atlanta, too -- Atlanta metro is huge -- tons of cities/towns.

Does someone maintain a directory of some type?

I thought Streetsblog used to have a directory of sorts, but seems it has gone away.

Thanks!
I'm trying to put together a list of books on topics related to planning, land use, and transit. What books should go on an urbanist's reading list? 

Here's a few of my recommendations to start (in no particular order):

1. The Power Broker by Robert Caro
2. Arbitrary Lines by M. Nolan Gray
3. The Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs
4. Paved Paradise by Henry Grabar
5. Confessions of a Recovering Engineer by Charles Marohn Jr
6. The Color of Law by Richard Rothstien 
7. The High Cost of Free Parking by Donald Shoup
8. The New Geography of Jobs by Enrico Moretti
I’m a Sydney based planner looking to move to NYC.

Here in Sydney there’s a few companies that specialise in recruitment for urban planning, but I can’t seem to find anything similar in NYC, or even companies that mention it on their website.

I’ve scoured LinkedIn looking for recruiters in NYC with that in their title.

Any suggestions?
Hello, I have recently become fascinated by the urban fabric and development in Central Europe. Are there any books that cover how cities/urban planning developed in this part of the world? I am particularly interested in the [Gründerzeitviertel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnderzeitviertel)s.
Hello there, I am a MURP student working on a park plan for my capstone this year. The park I am working with has three stringently demarcated, organized community non-profit groups making decisions within it: a skatepark, a community garden, and the neighborhood association. The three groups operate more or less independently and are reaching a point of conflict on the use of resources and space within the park. It seems like there is resistance to collaboration because their interests are pretty divergent.

I would love to hear if anyone has any suggestions of peer-reviewed literature about managing this type of conflict or creating collaborative structures to bridge the communication gap there.
I visited Lahaina in February 2022. I really liked the historic downtown (gone), the banyan tree (gone) and the historic 19th century buildings (all gone).

Despite of that, I though that the town was pretty meh in regards of walkability. Same parking lots as anywhere in America, strip malls and cars running through every street. 

Since they'll need to rebuild it, do you think it will lead to some actions towards walkability and more people-oriented design, or it will be just rebuilt as it was? Any option that rebuilding will result in more car-dependent infrastructure put in place?

Maybe I’m a dream but I want to be a part of creating sustainable cities, in whatever capacity. 

What private sector position has the best power when deciding how a city is designed, and which policies are implemented? 

Essentially, where can I go where I won’t be a slave to writing reports and being stuck in an endless loop of bureaucracy.  

Also, Is a masters in urban planning worth it?

I work for a (very conservative) county government where we allow a landowner to build a primary residence and an accessory dwelling unit. Our current regs allow for up to 1,000 sq. ft. of living space in an accessory structure. We do not allow a second residence on a property unless it's zoned for multifamily.

Over the last few years, we've had residents push the limits of that 1,000 sq. ft. regulation. I've seen people apply for ADUs as big as 2,500 sq. ft. Obviously, they would either have to reduce the size or apply for a variance from that regulation. Well, we've been getting a lot of these variances, so much that we'll probably get at least one each month, and the BOA consistently approves them while loudly complaining about the regulation. They want to see it raised since it's clear that's what the people want. In discussions, they've mentioned raising it to 1,500 sq. ft. (that's 300 bigger than MY house!) but I just see the residents pushing THAT limit in 2-3 years. Will the BOA approve those variances, too? Most likely. At this point I feel like we're just holding residents hostage for an application fee.

So my thinking is, if we're essentially allowing two "full-sized" houses on a lot, this would be a good opportunity to pretty much eliminate single-family zoning since we're already allowing multiple houses on a lot.

Has anyone here been a part of (or just know of) any communities that have done something similar to this? If so, how was it done and how's it going? TIA!
I get that they provide benefits in terms of shade and the environment, but....as someone who rides my bike a lot, I always feel like falling tree branches (and in the case of pine trees, pinecones) on the bike paths are a potential safety hazard, no?

If we do plant trees along a bike lane, shouldn't they be a few feet away to prevent branches and other debris from falling on the bike path?
What's the process like, how can I participate, is it even possible in places like los angeles or seattle?
I don't think building better public transportation in cities is the solution to a lot of the issues we have with cities, like traffic congestion. I've commuted with public transportation most of my life and I still prefer driving, I've lived in southern Ontario most of my life, using mostly the TTC in Toronto, although people like to complain about it, its a really good transit system, one of the best in NA. Yet even with frequent service, taking public transit during rush hour is like being crammed in a sardine can. Now I live in the UK, even better transit system, but I have the same thoughts. I understand the rationale, I'd rather be stuck in bumper to bumper traffic in the comfort of my own vehicle, than fight for space inside a crammed public transit tin can. Even worlds best public transits like in Japan have the same problem.

I think the issue is deeper, there are just too many people in cities, and its only getting worse. If you look at the numbers, rural towns have been significantly declining in population since late 2000s/early 2010s, and big cities have been increasing in population. Rural towns are dying, even medium sized cities like Thunder Bay have been stagnating in growth. People today opt to live in and around big cities. And so to me I just see improving city public transit having the same issues as improving roads and widening highways. 

We need to incentivize moving to other places. The main reasons people move today are for education and work, and people will choose one place over another based on whichever has better infrastructure, utilities, amenities, recreation, people, etc. I'm going to focus on Canada. When it comes to education, Canada has ample universities and colleges all over, they can improve by developing programs that are more in demand. When it comes to work, Canada like much of the west is post industrial, the biggest job sector is services, service jobs are much easier to relocate than others like in the industrial or agricultural sectors.

Though I think the biggest factor we need to invest in is the the national public rail system. Canada is very poorly connected, the biggest cities are Montreal, Toronto, Calgary, and Vancouver, and they're all far apart, so driving is a hassle. The train is often more expensive than flying, flying is the most efficient though still relatively expensive and more annoying. Its no wonder that most Canadians have travelled abroad to the US or overseas, yet haven't to another province outside of their own! I'm of the philosophy that if you connect people, then people will come, so I'm really in favour of improving the national rail system, its not bad, but high speed rails would bring a lot of benefit, or something as simple as making the trains cheaper. 

TLDR: 

* Too many people in cities is the real issue
* Rural towns are declining in population, cities are significantly increasing
* Create more service jobs in rural towns/medium-small cities
* Improve national rails/ make it cheaper

I made a video talking about how this small city ended up with such great density while also having beautiful buildings! I'd love to start a discussion on the topic, feel free to check out the video!
I've been wanting to re-create the buildings I see in my dreams and make a city out of them but I suck at drawing and I wanted to know if there was city-designing programs around I could try? Something like Sweet Home 3D (creating boundaries, making walls, putting objects around, all that jazz), but for cities (including 3d rendering support).

I'm not even against using a game engine (so long as it's not minecraft, damn).
I’m in my mid 20s with a degree in Urban Planning. I have over a years experience as a Permit Technician at a city job. I’ve been applying for assistant planning positions  that are meant to be for those starting out in the industry. I make it to the 2nd-3rd round of interviews just to continue to be rejected.
The last one hurt the most as it would of been an external hire at my city as an assistant planner. I knew everyone well, they knew I wanted it, I was vouched by staff, and made it to the second interview. Just to be rejected again. 
I want to be a planner so badly. I know what the job is like starting out, I know it’s not glamorous or anything (I mean I still think it’s awesome just nothing crazy I’m planning world of things)
Why can’t I get it? I feel so hurt and want to just give up. I’m not sure now if I should just focus on my permit tech position and take a break from applying or if I should keep putting myself out there.

I know I’m young and this happens but I’m just so exhausted. If anyone has any words of encouragement or advice, I’ll take it.

(small rant)

Here in Michigan, we really don't ask for much. A nice and safe place to live, a decent job, and time with friends and family... that's about it. When we ***do*** actually ask for more than that, we're as pragmatic as possible.

One thing that we've been asking for, for a long time is comprehensive regional transit, and it seems like we've been eating shit ever since we started asking for it.

Back in the day we had SEMTA, a big transit agency that covered all of southeast Michigan. But [after the commuter rail that it operated vanished in 1983 due to budget cuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEMTA_Commuter_Rail), SEMTA became SMART and reduced it's authority from all of Southeastern Michigan to just Wayne, Washtenaw, Oakland, and Macomb counties.

It wasnt until 2012 that Metro Detroit got some more attention from electeds in Lansing when they [signed a bill that created the RTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Transit_Authority_of_Southeast_Michigan) that would serve as the umbrella organization that oversees all the transit agencies that are located in Metro Detroit.

Because Lansing was ran by Republicans at the time, this assumed breakthrough in transit for the region came with some caveats: The RTA was restricted in raising revenue to only allow for property tax increases and nothing else ***and*** any implementation of rail transit requires a unanimous vote of it's appointed board (basically, the RTA ate ***a lot*** of shit)

Then, the RTA formulated a ballot proposal in 2016 that would've established BRT and commuter rail to Ann Arbor, but, suburban conservatives shot it down and the entire region ate massive piles of shit.

Since then, the RTA hasn't done anything of note besides creating express busses that go downtown on most arterial roads (which, are decent, not bad but not great either). 

Metro Detroiters have been waiting patiently for any new developments in transit for a while now and we're desperately tired of eating shit over and over again. Since 2016, we've been prisoners of our own desires, even on my local sub we had [a post essentially gaslighting ourselves](https://np.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/12fzih2/prediction_the_michigan_legislature_will_address/) into thinking that our Dem trifecta government will finally deliver comprehensive regional transit based on a couple of tweets.

Unfortunately it appears that we're doomed to be digesting feces for the foreseeable future. The legislature just passed a budget that had next to nothing going towards transit in it, and there hasn't been any signs from Governor Whitmer that regional/statewide transit is on her agenda.

I've been gaslighting myself into thinking that transit will get taken care of in 2024 since it's an election year, but I'm not holding my breath, the legislature has churned out liberal bills and whatnot, they just don't seem to care about transit.

In the meantime, I'll continue to nibble on excrement while waiting for my hourly crosstown bus when I get off of work (except on sunday because it doesn't run at all on sunday) that won't run after 9:00pm

Fuck me, /rant
Oscar Newman’s book *Defensible Space* outlines many problems with building improper infrastructure and it’s association with higher crime rates.

I’ve seen a lot proposals being made about converting downtown office buildings into affordable housing / apartments, this is a profoundly terrible idea.

TLDR: after 6 stories high felonious crime rates rise exponentially, but we can solve these issues.
Baseball stadiums always seem to be centrally located, with plenty of shops, housing and transit nearby (save for Dodger stadium in LA). Football stadiums, despite being roughly the same size, are usually out in an industrial area or the middle of nowhere off a highway, surrounded by an oceanic parking lot and not much else. 

Is this just because of the different eras when the two sports were most popular? Or is it related to fan demographics? Or am I just making up this correlation?
I have currently been reading a lot of books highlighting people-centric urban design and emphasis on multi modal use of roadways.

I am trying to understand the flip side: the car-centric approach to planning. I just want to make sure I am covering all my bases to see planning from all perspectives. Does anyone know of any car-centric literature?
Different animals can act as predators towards others or scare them by chasing them for example. Animals like cats, dogs, and guinea pigs need fresh air and sunlight, though, and change in environment and being exposed to plants, microbes, dirt, movement in environment, etc. can be good for them, not to mention things like forest therapy, earthing, and nature therapy which, as earthy as they may sound, have evidence to support them.
I did an interview for the transit dept planning position within my city. (They're separate from the planning dept where I am now- no one knows why. 😅) They mentioned merit increases for transit certs and quals. I really can't find any I could work on except for Professional Transportation Planner (PTP) certification from TPCB. I'm in Virginia, but they don't value VAZO certification. Are there any transportation programs you know of that I would be able to pursue privately for professional development?
I used to think it was only car-dependent cities that sprawled due to suburbia until I went to London.

The city has an area of 600 sq. miles. Why is it so big? Why does it stretch seemingly forever? 

What causes sprawl in walkable cities? London seems to have its own equivalents of suburbs too.
I’ve travelled through Europe and noticed that a lot of times walking is about the same travel time as taking transit (Berlin, Stockholm, Oslo). For example, it might be a 29 minute public transit option with a transfer or a 32 minute walk.
 
This often feels quite disappointing. The only reason I’d take transit would be if I’m tired then not because I want to save time.

I’m wondering why this is the case sometimes and not always. What can we say dictates the speed of public transit options and how can it be improved?

I'm new to this conservative community of 30k population. I graduated recently and have been in my position for only two months. I am the only city planner on staff but so far the rapport is great. My only challenge is that my public speaking nerves may be undermining some of the otherwise decent confidence they have in my abilities. I've met multiple times with the mayor and commissioners, each time seeming to have gained their appreciation for my analyses.

I still need to learn a ton of stuff but I can't help but insert myself strongly during this comprehensive plan update. I feel obligated to redirect some of the comprehensive planning consultants' suppositions. With the nature of the planning field as a nonstop academic critique, I've spent a good amount of time reading critical/boundary literature on long-range planning. I'd like to apply the wisdom I've picked up from others as they've reviewed the downsides to comprehensive planning. I'm not aiming to avoid a comp plan but want it to be more flexible with development patterns and to avoid locking us in to decisions made years in the past which no longer seem so great or even relevant.

In doing so, I hope to avoid more of the same problems that we experience from our 2013 plan (which was meant to be a 2035 plan). We're now updating that plan because it doesn't work... at all. It does more harm than good. Each time we wish to contradict it, we need an ordinance amendment and a public hearing process. It's horrible. So, it shouldn't be too much trouble to convince commissioners and other decision-makers that I can suggest improvements. Many of the things I'd suggest, they'd already hit on themselves. For example, shorter range review intervals by city staff and to not incorporate a FLUM that can only be updated via ordinance.

I'm reviewing the scoping documents now that we've received from the consultants. They seem technologically sophisticated but I'm afraid they will apply those "best practice" expertise toward more planned serendipity and supposing that they can understand what 2045 will actually look like. So, I want to propose that our comprehensive plan is in effect for no more than 10 years. I want to position it in our politicians' minds that the greatest benefit we get from spending $500k (combined transportation master plan + comp plan) is in having the consultants give us a much better picture of current conditions. We lack demographic data, housing supply and building type data, an overview of sidewalk and streets disconnects, and we have no staff acting as grant specialist to search for federal/state dollars.

I'm not sure how I want to start with this. My boss is the city engineer / community development director. I teach him planning perspectives but as an engineer, sometimes it doesn't make sense to him. Overall he's been great but at times it's difficult to filter planning through the city engineer before I can get ideas in front of others. He prefers to not make things "high level" before we have a plan. Though, this comp plan update will be breaking ground this fall. We're negotiating now. I can probably twist their arms without involving the mayor but what if they try hard to override me and my boss doesn't get where I'm coming from? He never has time to be sat down and have some of this planning stuff explained. He defers to me in many areas but sometimes I get anxious having no other planners in this city. It makes me feel like I should at some point deliver some kind of quarterly planning update to P&Z and explain some upsides and downsides to what the city has been doing. They've had several years with zero planning expertise and people just seeing what sticks. As a result we have some really funky leapfrog development and we're contending with an interstate AND a railroad slicing this small town into three sections. It's quite tricky to figure out how to make this all work. Part of the problem of having had no planners here is that there are often huge undertakings and financial asks without any staff input whatsoever! At last week's commission, the airport manager asked for $4mil toward utilities extensions and a new terminal and nobody thought to ask planning if committing basically years worth of CIP resources in that direction is a good idea.

So, given that I'm new but seemingly trusted, have the city engineer as my department head, and am about to begin comp plan work.... does anybody have solid advice for how to make sure everything turns out alright?
I wish there was a mode of transport that combined the efficiency of bus and train travel and the privacy and on demand timing of a personal car.
Does anybody know what kind of transportation that would be?
I was thinking personal rapid Transit pods but I was on another group and they told me that Transit pods don't work and aren't efficient.
Please be respectful and please don't respond with smart ass comments. This is a legitimate question.

I have always loved roundabouts and the place I live in Taiwan has a terrible intersection prone to accidents. Recently a neighbor of mine died at the intersection, and last year my aunt was struck by a motorcyclist and went into a coma due to the collision. I'm thinking of reaching out to the city to propose this brand-new intersection. However, many Taiwanese motorists aren't used to roundabouts and would have doubts about this project, are there suggestions you can give me to counter questions or do you see any problems in my not-professional draft that you think could be improved upon? Please let me know.

What kind of work does HUD do related to urban planning?
I’ve been trying to learn more about urban development and urbanism in general. I started learning more about old streetcar suburbs. I’m just curious as to what are some of the best examples of old streetcar suburbs that have been revitalized or in the process of revitalization in the US? It can be from large cities to small cities. Wondering if much of it still exists…

Edit: I’m not talking about transit itself. I’m more so saying the the reactivation of the commercial areas/neighborhoods around the lines. They tend to be more urban in form and walkable. A lot of them declined after WW2. Did they get revitalized or do they still exist by any chance? If they were always vibrant where you’re from, I would like to know of those area too.

Hello everyone. So bit of background information is that I worked in public relations/marketing for few years after undergraduate. I minored in planning and later got a full scholarship to transition and completed a Master in Urban Studies about two years ago. Tried to get an entry level planning job for several months after graduating but I found it extremely difficult during the weird transition of the pandemic plus not having any planning specific background/experience plus scarce opportunities (I was stubborn and wanted to live in a big city, not a suburb or random city). 

Eventually I started working at a private firm that specializes in community engagement in Philadelphia. So worked on various planning, transportation, real estate, even university planning projects. But from community engagement perspective.  

Experience was helpful and recently received a Planner 1 job offer in San Francisco for SFMTA Streets division - parking and curb management. Few days later, I was invited by another division to interview for another position - Planner 2 level position but it’s in Current Planning Division - Development Review. I haven’t received an offer yet but just thinking what if. There is 17k salary difference between the 2 positions. 

I’m from California so happy to move closer home and eager to get more planning specific job experience, but not really sure which position would be more better for me in the long run for a future job prospects. Being SF, I’m attracted to the higher salary but also want to think about experience without pidgeon holing myself. 

SFMTA position seems more interesting and maybe better experience gained in the long run, and maybe better for someone who hasn’t any planning specific experience? I somehow qualify for Planner 2, simply because I hold a master degree. 

I’m not really familiar with development review but from what I’ve read it seems like more paper pushing, dead end, soul sucking kind of work. Not sure if that’s actually true or if it would still allow for getting experience in other areas or eventually branching off. I’m mainly attracted to this position for the higher salary. Since it’s the same employer basically with different agencies & divisions, all other benefits are equal as far as I know. 

I’m super happy to be offered any government job with great benefits, stability and prospects of gaining some experience in next 5+ years least. This hiring process took almost 1.5 years…!!

Can anyone weigh in and give their thoughts? What would you do in my shoes?
This is probably not exactly the right place to ask so feel free to redirect me if you know where would be better.

So a house can have a battery backup that works when the grid goes down. That house can also put power back into the grid when it's up. Grids can have a sort of "nesting" system where grid A is a sub grid of B which is a subgrid of the entire eastern seabord.

So with all that. Could a small municipality, like an independent village/street car suberb of a major metro area create its own municipal grid that all the homes in that municipality connect to, throw in some batteries and maybe a few smaller power generation options controlled by a local official and make it so all of small-hamlits-ville TX stays operational while the larger state grid freezes?

Pretty far from an expert, but I did jump a neighbors car yesterday so clearly I know some things about electricity and neighborhoods (this is a joke, I'm a lame man feel free to tell me the 98 ways this doesn't work I love to learn)
I’ve done regional planning for the past two years and will be starting a city planner job next week. I’ve specialized in long range land use planning. I am lacking short range planning which is what I’ll mostly be doing. I’ve been looking over their zoning code. But is there anything else I can do? Thanks!
I have always lived in large metro areas, grew up in Phoenix where I started and finished my degree in urban planning, and lived in Miami for a bit, but life circumstances have led me to live in a much smaller city in the south for the next 2 years. Since I just recently graduated, I just got my first planning job with the county out here. I definitely plan to move to a big city again after these couple years are up but I’m wondering how different my planning experience would be.

This county has a couple of small urban centers but I’m working only for the non establishment areas, so the more rural/agricultural areas. Most of the county is not zoned, but in the last few years districts have been voting and going through the process of zoning. Lots of the residents are against zoning and think all government involvement or regulations are bad, so that’s what I hear a lot of from the public. They basically disprove of any new developments and don’t like change, even though this is currently the fastest growing county in the state. It has been nice though when you can educate citizens on zoning and turn them into supporters of it.

So just out of curiosity, will my experience in this job translate well to a planning position in a bigger city, or will it be a completely different experience? Has anyone worked in both environments and preferred one over the other?



Hello,

I am making this post because I want to advocate for zoning reform in my community, but there isn't really any precedent for ordinary citizens getting involved in planning in that way, and I don't want people in city government to feel like their toes are getting stepped on.

For context, I live in a 150k pop. rust belt city with terrible land use planning ihmo. Mixed use dev is only legal on 0.5% of the land area, and there are even historic mixed use blocks that are now zoned as general low density commercial.
There was massive suburban expansion over the last 80 years, and now the inner early strip mall/ boxstore developments are struggling/ abandoned, and I don't think it would make any sense to redevelop these areas in a way that we know doesn't work. In my opinion we should be promoting more walkable density around our city center, not stripmalls.

I have no education in planning but I have read our zoning code and looked at examples of zoning reforms. The most intriguing to me is what they have done in South Bend, Indiana with form based codes. I think this a good example for my community as they are remarkably similar in the trajectory of their development pattern and culture except that we don't have a university.

I understand that completely rewriting a code is a large undertaking and not necessarily feasible, but I want the leaders and administrators to know that this is something that is desired in the community.

My main question is, as planners, how do prefer that the public advocate for zoning reform. Any suggestions or advice is appreciated.

Edit: the city is rockford, IL for anyone curious
My current summer internship is coming to a close and i’m starting to look into some for next year. I am about to go into my junior year of college, so i’d prefer if my next one is in a city/ region I hopefully end up in. I don’t really have a preference as to where, I just want to move out of Ohio ideally or at least experience living somewhere new. I know some companies offer housing stipends to interns, has anyone had an experience like that with a city planning related internship? All of my friends who got those are business majors so I’m not even sure if it’s something urban planning firms do. I’m mainly interested in housing/ community development but i’m open to others too.

Besides the obvious: bricks look better, are more sustainable, and easier to access infrastructure below. Why are bricks so unpopular? I get it why they are not used on highways, but in cities it seems only obvious...
(Not cobble)
Just something I've been thinking about.  Many cities in the US ban manufactured homes on regular residential lots, presumably due to the association with trailer parks and the cultural perception that they are "trashy".  Of course, getting cities to even allow duplexes/triplexes on regular lots is a battle still being fought in many/most cities as well.

I was thinking about how much less expensive manufactured homes tend to be as compared to traditional construction, and they can save on construction labor needed and allow homes to go up and be inhabited much more quickly than traditional homebuilders can enable.  There are some manufacturers out there making manufactured/modular multiplexes.  Their plans could even be pre-approved by cities to streamline the permitting process.

Could this help make a dent in the housing shortage and speed up the process of getting supply and demand back in alignment?  Are there some negative side effects to think about?  For example, are these homes actually lower-quality and shorter-lasting than traditional homes, or is that just a false perception and the maintenance requirements and longevity are closer than people think?

I’m doing and interview and test for the position tomorrow and I was never told what the test was on and I’m nervous because it’s going to be a live test in front of a committee as I understand. Can someone give a guess to what it may be on? Please and thanks!
I'm a GIS expert, Strong Towns advocate, member of my town's planning commission.  I hate NIMBYs with a passion, and my biggest goal as a planning commission member is to reduce the role that zoning plays on the local level where I live.  My town is a small 1st ring suburb of a major metropolitan area.  
Lately, AirBNBs and VRBOs have become a hot topic, and I'm unsure of the best way to deal with them.  The knee-jerk reaction from the old guard NIMBY folks is to ban them because they're "not in keeping with our community's values".  Statements like those make me want to puke.  IMO, there should be absolutely nothing wrong with making a little extra money by renting a room out in your home, or even renting your home out while you're away.  
On the flip side, there are a couple homes in our city that have become problematic.  Huge groups of people moving in and out every few days, poorly managed homes with garbage over flowing, cars parked up and down the block, etc.  These homeowners who are maximizing every dollar they can by overfilling their homes with unvetted people are obviously being bad neighbors.  
I've also heard about some of the issues with investors snatching up homes and turning  them immediately in AirBNBs, thus exacerbating the housing shortage.  
My suggestion is to have a few simple rules in place.  
A.  The home needs to either be your primary residence or you must live within the city  
B.  You need to apply for a permit with the city for a very nominal fee.  
C.  If you receive X number of nuicesance compaints (as long as they're in good faith) or have had X number of police issues due to violating noise/garbage/parking ordinances, your permit will be revoked.  
To me that takes care of the problem homes, and doesn't restrict people in our city from peacefully using their properties how they see fit.  
Thoughts on this, or on short-term rentals as they apply to urban planning in general?

My local government is holding a public meeting to gather the community’s feedback about their upcoming project to redesign a popular bus route corridor. 

Possible improvements include 
* Faster and more reliable bus service
* Better pedestrian infrastructure like sidewalks and crosswalks
* Improved bicycle infrastructure
* Better parking and loading zones for cars
* More and better bus shelters
* New pavement on roads for buses, cars, bikes, and others

The street mostly ranges from 20 to 30 meters wide between buildings. Most of the route has parking on both sides of the street, and then one to two lanes of traffic in either direction. The link to the project page is below.

[Project page](https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/transit-priority-corridors/route-57-transit-priority-corridor)

At the public meeting, what questions or concerns would you raise to the city staff? I would love to see less car-dependency, more bike infrastructure that is actually protected, and more efficient public transportation. I fear of being stuck with a poorly designed street for decades to come! Thank you for the help. Any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated.


Hey everyone. I just graduated this past June with an honours planning degree from an accredited planning program. I wanted to know if I had to use my degree right away? I know that I don’t “have to” but I wanted to here all of your takes on this topic. I’ve gotten a job opportunity in a different untalented field that I want to take, the pay is much less than a planner but it’s for something I’m passionate about. How long would be too long to wait to use my degree. I’d like to use it at some point. When talking to some of my colleagues I was told that the longer you wait the less appealing of a candidate you would look like. Is this true? If so what is a fair amount of time to wait before it starts to look bad on a job application. If there are any hiring managers reading this do you have an suggestions on what I could say to explain the employment gap?

A bit of a tactical ~~urbanism~~ moderation trial to help concentrate common questions around career and education advice.

**The current soft trial will:**

\- To the extent possible, refer users posting these threads to the scheduled posts.

\- Test the waters for aggregating this sort of discussion

\- Take feedback (in this thread) about whether this is useful

**If it goes well:**

\- We would add a formal rule to direct conversation about education or career advice to these threads

\- Ask users to help direct users to these threads

**Goal:**

To reduce the number of posts asking somewhat similar questions about Education or Career advice and to make the previous discussions more readily accessible.
Stumbled across this very [interesting project](https://www.piscataquisvillage.org/) that would have, in their words "combined the best practices from history and around the world to create a modern, rural micropolis in central Maine." It  focused on six key design elements: 1) Small plazas; 2) Narrow streets; 3) Exclusively attached housing; 4) Arcaded sidewalks; 5) Courtyards; and, most ambitiously of all, 6) Car free. It generated quite some buzz back in 2012/2013 (you can still read some of the articles linked on their homepage) but appears to have fizzled out. 

Probably an idea 10 years ahead of its time. I bet they couldn't find enough interest then but might be able to now. Also a shame that a project like this *could only* happen in a place like rural Maine without zoning and that the closer you get to civilization the tighter the zoning straightjacket and louder the nimby cries become. 

Any other projects like this out there (failed or not)? 

I work in a primarily suburban jurisdiction where we are trying to balance adding more variety of housing types (i.e. duplex, 3-8 unit townhouses) into new subdivisions under a new Village Residential category that stresses smaller lot sizes and moderate density (between typical suburban detached homes and multi-family apartments). We get PUDs with mixed housing but I'm trying to get away from them and include housing variety as "by-right".

My Planning Commission and Township Board have expressed a desire for housing variety, but I need to avoid subdivisions full of one single type, they don't want hundreds of units of duplexes for example. At the same time, for smaller infill projects a pure townhouse or duplex might be appropriate, so I don't want to exclude the possibility with a straight "33% townhouse units, 33% duplex units, 33% single family detached" kind of requirement. Any system needs to be clear for developers and respond to market demand. 

My question to the group is whether anyone has examples of ordinance language that specifies requiring  a mix of  housing types and how that might be done? Something like a ratio, or sliding scale of housing types based on parcel size? Any creative thoughts are appreciated. 
Please use this thread for memes and other types of shitposting not normally allowed on the sub. This thread will be moderated minimally; have at it.

Feel free to also post about what you're up to lately, questions that don't warrant a full thread, advice, etc. Really anything goes.

Note: these threads will be replaced monthly.
A few months ago I took a civil engineering class on Sustainable Transportation and one of the topics was Transit Oriented Development. I began to consider whether anyone has considered a transit oriented hospital or medical facility.

I worked in a medical office at one point and noticed that the majority of patients were over 60 and drove or use on-demand Paratransit. I also think that medical facilities would be a  sensible destination to connect as they are often large trip sources/generators for employees and patients and car-dependent hospitals often require parking lots that make some stadiums look tiny.

 I was just wondering if anyone knows of when a city planned a hospital around a transit stop or if a hospital was ever intentionally built nearby a transit stop.

Hi, everyone! 

A week I landed my first planning internship at a city. I am very excited since I’ve been trying to land one for a while now. I wanted to know what to expect and what some of the things planning interns first learn because I have no idea as of yet. 

I’m excited to start but eager to know. Thank you :)

Hello, I've taken a huge interest in urban planning. I am attending school for it, in my second year. I was going to focus on urban planning, but I have realized I rural America is often left behind in these discussions. NotJustBikes definitely lit an anger I had with car dependency that I couldn't name at the time. But like his channel and many others they strictly talk about cities or sometimes larger towns.  I lived in a small town (under 7000 people) practically my whole life. It is extremely car dependent, and I grew up poor so seeing the financial stress my parents went through and seeing that your car is as important as your house. Rarely anyone works in our town, but rather it's used as a commuter town where you live here and drive to the city to work. I also live on route 20, so I think there can be a lot of potential with growth in my specific town with that. 

On a larger scale, looking at rural America, I wonder if there is anything we can even do. At the same time there have been some efforts to bring in new constructions, etc. but apparently we have a lot of closed minded, older folk, NIMBYs that fight against it. Not to mention drug problems, education issues, etc. that exist in rural areas. I want desperately to try and fix or at least improve towns like mine. I want rural places to retain their rural identities without becoming cities. Of course this does not mean I don't think downtowns, etc. are out of the question. Those are things I think that can actually help rural America. But I wonder if we can or even should help rural America. I feel lost and hopeless (dramatic ik but this topic means a lot to me), any sort of pointer in a good direction to research is something I would greatly appreciate. I was thinking about researching rural American history and then comparing it to other countries to see how they fare. Not sure if this is a good start or not.

**TLDR; Is there any point and/or way to save or at least improve rural America? Where can I research this subject further to find solutions?**
There is a north-south road in my area that connects to multiple major east-west, NE-SW, and NW-SE highways (both freeways and surface roads), making it function somewhere in between an arterial and a collector for car traffic. It is mostly two lanes wide, with certain sections having an extra turn lane, painted median, or TWLTL, and has a speed limit of 30mph (40mph for one ~1.5 mile section) which is almost universally ignored. It is mostly fronted by single family homes, a few stores, two medium-sized malls, residential and industrial developments, undeveloped forests, and one small commuter rail station. The area is kind of on the edge of suburban, exurban, and rural, and the road itself has a disconnected and inconsistent sidewalk network.



Hi All,

Looking at possibly applying for a job with PlaceWorks in California and I wonder if anyone knows anything about them. I had never heard of them until I saw the job advertisement. Thanks!
Is there any research as to where people are displaced to from their original location? How many people are moving to a nearby area, vs the outskirts vs out of a city or state entirely?
I’ve seen suburbs like footscray in Melbourne, Australia that combine offices, restaurants, shops and residences in a neighbourhood and they’re often lively with ppl of all ages hanging around with them walking or using bikes. They remind me of the neighbourhoods in switzerland that use single roads and dedicate pedestrian spaces. It can work so well but the new developments in the growing areas of Melbourne insist on house only suburbs that often lead to empty streets and large roads. Theres good things tho like consistent train stations and bus stops around but otherwise the suburbs could definitely be better.
It has always surprised me that multiculturalism is a rarely discussed topic in urban planning & "urbanist" circles, especially given the status of many cities around the world as cosmopolitan hubs of ethnocultural & religious diversity. Cities around the world such as London, NYC, Sydney, Toronto, Melbourne, Los Angeles, Chicago, Berlin, & São Paulo are well known for hosting diverse communities from countries around the world. 

The impact of immigration on the development of cities and neighborhoods around the world cannot be understated. New York City would look very different today if neighborhoods like Chinatown Manhattan, Flushing, Lower East Side, & Little Italy weren't shaped by waves of immigrants coming to America in search of a better life. Toronto's iconic Kensington Market neighborhood was built by Jewish immigrants in the early 1900s & is now home to people from Asia, Latin America, & the Caribbean. A lot of the early streetcar suburbs across North America were built by & for new immigrants.

Urban cultural & religious diversity changes cities through new commercial businesses, houses of worship, community centers, educational facilities, & social service organizations so I'm surprised that it's not talked about more often in online planning circles.
Hello to my fellow planners, professionals and enthusiasts, 

I've served 2 years at our local planning commission and have been part of a few infill projects (not relevant to this question). Our latest (personal) project is splitting raw land from 2.3 acres to 5 lots (each roughly .33 with one that is larger). It is zoned by right to have this split go through without needing to rezone. The split will be needing to go through the planning commission. 

The problem that I am dealing with is, there are 13 parking spots on our lot towards the rear where a neighboring lot (permitted to have a church) is using. The planning department is pushing to do a lot line adjustment to give the neighboring lot the parking spots. 

The church has ample parking (another \~50 parking spots) but based on code (from 1970) still not meeting the requirements. 

My thoughts: If we now own the land (the church sold us the lot), we can do anything with the parking spots, and if it makes them (more) non-compliant with parking, why should it affect me? 

BTW: We will still continue to let the church use the parking even after we split and build, but I do not want to just give away our portion of land. 

I do agree, that if the church wanted to use the parking lot, they should have did a lot adjustment prior to sale and only sold the portion of the lot that did not contain the parking? 

What are your thoughts on this? Should the city enforce us giving away the parking spaces, or siding with a developer? and why? Any legal weight behind the decision? 

Thank you for your input!


More specifically, as an urban planner working on a TOD project, what is/was your role in it? Did you enjoy your work? Did you find it fulfilling and did you feel like you made a difference whether that be reduced emissions, better public health, better mental and social health, or something totally different? And do you have any tips for aspiring urban planners who want to get involved in such TOD projects? What sort of experience should one get before trying to get involved in one?


I'm need a dataset that has racial demographics for US cities with a population over 40,000. If I could find one that has a lower bound less than 40k, that would work as well with some cleaning up. Does anyone know where I should look? Obviously [census.gov](https://census.gov) will likely have what I'm looking for, but would love suggestions on how to consolidate the data set to just what I'm looking for (the five census designated racial categories for each city w/pop 40,000+). 

I live in White Plains, New York, where numerous, massive "luxury rental" high rises are under development. See [The Journal News, Jan. 25, 2023, "How thousands of new rental units are changing the face of White Plains."](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2023/01/25/white-plains-ny-housing-projects-adding-thousands-rental-units/69721080007/) I am advocating for inclusion of the secondary effects of these projects on small businesses and long-term residents in environmental review. However, I would like to take an honest and open-minded look at what the effects of constructing such "luxury rental" high rises actually are. Do such projects tend to increase rents by "upscaling" the community? Do they bring a dynamism to the area that brings evictions with it? Do they decrease rents through the addition of new housing stock? Do they change the mix of retail businesses in a neighborhood? And other such effects . . . .

White Plains is a city greatly affected by its close proximity and mass transit connections to New York City. It has generally high demand for housing and high costs.

The 1986 New York Court of Appeals decision [Chinese Staff & Workers Assn. v City of New York](https://govt.westlaw.com/nyofficial/Document/I9b5b869ad92e11d99439b076ef9ec4de) found that residents of Manhattan's Chinatown neighborhood were entitled to environmental review of secondary effects of construction "of Henry Street Tower, a high-rise luxury condominium." The project did not displace any residents or businesses from its footprint (it was built on a vacant lot), but the Court credited residents' fears that its secondary effects would push out neighborhood small businesses and long-term residents.
Look, I get it.  Los Angeles isn't the most walkable or transit/cyclist/pedestrian friendly city in the US.

But like all things considered, its probably the best US city outside of the Northeast not named San Francisco or Chicago for urbanism and transit.  At worst its in the top 10 for US cities in terms of walkability and transit.  There are plenty of US cities doing much worse than LA, such as Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Atlanta, San Antonio, Orlando, Tampa, etc.

Hell, you only need to go south by 100 miles to see a city doing much worse than LA for transit in San Diego - a city that has a density HALF of LA's, a city that's doing literally nothing right now for transit expansion compared to LA's Measure M projects.  Things have gotten to the point a county supervisor in San Diego County [tweeted to Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/jim_desmond/status/1618711624948367360?t=llSYQ1BHjqzakArHPboo4Q&s=19) asking him to build his tunnels in San Diego.  As good a reputation that it has, [San Diego's urban core's](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/06000US0607392780-san-diego-ccd-san-diego-county-ca/) transit modal rideshare is a third of [Los Angeles'](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/06000US0603791750-los-angeles-ccd-los-angeles-county-ca/). (3% vs 9%).

I guess really the premise of my question is, why does LA get so much attention for poor urbanism and transit when Dallas and Houston exist?
I live in a small city in Ohio and it is scary biking on major thoroughfares. Ohio does have bike paths that run through rural areas that come through my city. But urban bike infrastructure is a joke.

I was excited to see a seperated bike lane, protected by a curb on a large thoroughfare they were reconstructing on my side of town, which people probably consider a rough area. I was so excited, but the bike lane will only go for 1/2 mile then just disappear. 🤣 what a joke. 

On this same side of town, a historical neighborhood has gated blocks that block through car traffic as a way to reduce crime and make the blocks more kid friendly. This is rather old infrastructure now and is a little bit contentious. But these gates got me thinking.

In a forgotten neighborhood like this where there is a lot of abandonment and disinvestment could we close off a route of residential streets that run parallel(ish) to the major thoroughfares. Closed off to car traffic to make them bike Boulevards? Seems like low stakes because there is so little attention paid to my side of town. There are already gated blocks here and there, but it would make the 15-25 minute bike ride to Downtown so safe and easy.

Are there any examples of such a thing in any American city? Or perhaps another continent too? I think I'm onto something, but realize I'm probably overly optimistic.
Urban planning is my dream job, it’s what I want to do. I have the option to pursue a masters in city and regional planning from a great school this Fall, but the thing holding me back is I worry there simply aren’t enough jobs in the field. As much as I want to do it, I’d rather not have the stress of unemployment in my life..
Okay, there’s not really a core 8. But generally when talking about walkable cities, the same ones come up, separated into 3 tiers.

NY: The tier is eponymous

Tier 1: Philly, Boston, DC, SF, Chicago

Tier 2: Seattle, Portland

Outside of these commonly cited walkable cities, what are the best for density and walkability in the United States?
Do you think that it would be easier to be an urban planner in liberal/more progressive cities than conservative ones?
Hi all! I recently started a new role where neither our Communications or IT team have the technological capability to help run a hybrid public meeting. For those with experience doing them, what are the critical items needed or best practices in your opinion? Camera, speakers, tripod, meeting platforms etc. I’m hoping to gather some info and provide leadership a budget/justification to get us started on acquiring some of these things. Having double meetings (in-person and virtual) spends a lot of staff time that we simply don’t have with existing workloads.

Thanks for any insight you all can provide!
Here are a few diagrams illustrating the typical street grid configurations for Chicago's residential "subdivisions/quarter-sections."

Or even better, a boundary gradient based on travel time to CBD(s)?
It’s easy to only focus on the negatives in US planning, so I’m curious to hear from professionals:

What US municipalities, regions, or states have made the most positive change over the past 5-10 years?

What areas are leading on housing? Transportation? Sustainability?

What parts of the US keep you inspired, and why?
Planners/urban designers in or from India: are there any policies or projects that pops out at you that would make for a great visit/case study? I love urbanist tourism and would love to learn more best practices from a non-western/non-European viewpoint. Asking specifically about the Indian and South Asian context because that’s where I’ll be going for a few months this Fall. 

Any cities doing cool things in the plannosphere that would be worth a visit? If so, do share :). 

I’m from the US, for context. I’ve been to India before, but this time want to see more cities and neighborhoods.

Thanks!

Is there any data on how attitudes towards urban planning in America have changed? I'm wondering if the gradual shifts we seen towards functional urbanism reflect a wider societal shifts.

A developer is trying to build a self-storage facility near me and there seems to be some controversy around it on the planning board. I’ve also heard of a few cities banning them. Being somewhat of a minimalist, I’ve never understood why people would want to rent one and think they’re kinda pointless. But I’m also pretty unfamiliar with planning aspects of such businesses. Do they cause a lot of unnecessary vehicle traffic? Are they predatory towards low-income people? Or are they just a generally wasteful use of high-value land? I’m pretty uneducated on this issue.
I am a recent graduate, having studied Geography and GIS. I’ve always harnessed a passion for urban/town planning and improving the human environment. On a whim, I applied for a Planner I position, and I was offered the job! I’ve never even had an internship in anything planning related. The firm is relatively small, concentrated in the American southeast. What should I expect to surprise me?
(Utrecht, Netherlands) During my study in college for a fictional organisation, I'm writing an advice report with developing trends and innovations on Urban Planning. Trends like the reducing amounts of personal motorized vehicles and the continous adaption of public transport are great examples. The 10 Minute City concept, the diversity of greenery. Eventually I'll be advising them how to steer urban planning towards the year of 2050. I apologize for the poor phrasing, as Urban Planning is nowhere near my profession, yet I'm keen to learn about it.  


Please share some promising technologies and innovations in Urban Planning and how historical cities can adapt in the future.



EDIT: thank you all for the interesting comments, I will be going through all mentioned trends today. Very insightful!

I am looking for sources that address the practical ways that urban design can account for race, class, gender, and disability differences.  I am teaching a class and its easier to find theory than it is to find stuff that is practical and readable.  Any ideas are welcome whether it is books, articles, websites, videos, etc.
I see a lot of people on here complain about their job and how they wish they pursued something different. This has me worried as I was planning on going back to school for Urban Planning. From the various threads I’ve read on here, it’s just telling people no and that doesn’t sound very fun. As juvenile as this may sound, I want to make a difference and see a change for the better in terms of planning/infrastructure. What might be a decent alternative, career-wise?

Do you guys enjoy what you do? If so, could you explain.
Everyone here is probably intimately aware of the intricacies that go into planning and development. A developer wants to build some apartments -> they go to a municipality to ask for development rights -> once the rights are granted, they search for a loan to secure financing for their apartments -> once financing is secured, the apartments get built and the developer starts renting out units.

Many users on this sub take issue with the bottleneck that happens in some municipalities when they either reduce in size or reject developments because of zoning codes, those same people like to point to zoning codes as the reason why housing becomes so expensive. 

But, as a believer in left wing politics, I can see a far larger problem that effects housing prices even more than approvals do: apartment financing.

It's just taken as a given that developers ***need*** to go through finance capital channels in order to get their units financed because they don't see dollars coming from anywhere else. This, in fact, is a failure of municipal/regional governments to step up and supply the market with cheap money to keep housing affordable (financing can often be 80% of development costs).

But, there may be some of you already asking yourselves: "where is money like that gonna come from?", and that brings me to my main point: Municipal/regional governments ***need*** to start Regional Investment Banks (RIBs)

### What is a Regional Investment Bank?

Regional investment banks aren't like commercial lending banks, they usually provide funds to businesses, investors, and especially governments to catalyze specific projects (think implementing something like a Green New Deal).

A municipal/regional investment bank could be used to give developers grants for various projects so the total cost of rent is brought down to affordable levels. It could also be used to fund purpose-made social housing and co-ops for local governments

That still leaves the question of how the RIB will be capitalized, simply put, the capital would come from municipal bonds levied as a percentage of a region's GDP (like 20%, 50%, 130% etc.)

The operation of the RIB would be manned by both appointed and elected members so citizens have a say while governments are  able to provide the expertise in the RIB's financial matters.


So, what do you guys think? Do you see RIBs as an alternative to the current finance capital-controlled building process? If not, what are your ideas for an alternative?
I am curious if there is database on how many cars are using interstate highways through out the day.

I am asking this because about 6 months ago, our local interstate finished 9 mile long express lane.

But the thing is... no one is using it because of stupid dynamic toll rate, it costs you around $10-15 to go couple miles during rush hours.

This is really sad because it costed $3.7 billion dollars and miserable driving experience for years due to construction and I see barely anyone using it even in stop and go traffic (But this maybe due to lack of entrance/ exit points as well)

In my personal view this seems like giant waste of money and wish this money was used to extend/ improve little metro access we have.

&#x200B;

Edit: 

I am based in US - also this is purely based on my personal experience, driving on the highway daily basis, seeing how empty the express lanes are even when I am stuck in stop and go traffic. 

That's why I like to look at the actual data for the case study, not based on my personal experience. 

IF express lanes are actually being used enough, I will rest my case. 

But again, how much usage is needed to justify such a construction?  
I am working on a walkable city project (just personal, nothing real) and I am really fascinated that it was done in Culdesac. 

Does someone has cost data about it? 

Also do we have feedback from the residents about welcome improvements, adjustments needed to make even better?

&#x200B;
I’ve heard a lot about how LA is improving and expanding its (rapid) transit network massively, but is it doing an equivalent push in land use, with TOD for example? cause trains are great, but if they only serve single family homes, they’re a bit of a waste of money
Obviously sharrows aren't the ideal solution, but some streets probably just aren't wide enough to accommodate nice wide bike lanes that provide a safe and comfortable cycling experience.

I've seen the main criticism of sharrows to be the confusion that they cause to drivers, who misunderstand them to be a message to cyclists to share the road with cars. Having the opposite of the intended effect.

However some newer sharrows I've seen have had signs that they say either 'Take the lane' or 'single file'. Instructing bikers cars to pass by going into the other lane completely and asking bikers in some cases to ride in the centre of the lane. In many cases this has been combined with a posted speed limit of 20mph or 30km/h. And cars tend to respect this limit.

Thoughts?
I'm evaluating ideas for affordable housing for an essay. One proposal is moving small cities (<100,000 people) into a large 1 mile by 1 mile, well insulated, adequately ventilated, climate controlled warehouse with 4 story apartment complexes and amenities like gyms, restaurants, cinemas, universities close by. The roof would have a large wall to wall OLED display to mimic natural outdoor lighting. The houses could be made cheaply as they would not need to face the elements like wind, rain and snow. With a grid layout, robotic services for goods delivery would be easy to implement. Similar advantages would extend to utility layouts like underground electric, water and sewage lines. There would be no roads as most amenities would be in walking distance. This proposoal might appeal more to remote workers, but if located close to rapid transit railway or highway routes, this would also enable housing of in-person workers. Lots of parks in the vicinity might enable outdoor activities. Good policing would also allow reduced crime and drug abuse. Midwestern states like MN with a harsh winter climate would benefit from lower energy expenditure. Other benefits would include lower infrastructure costs from roads.

What are your thoughts about the benefits and disadvantages of this idea?

The Dutch of Singaporean models probably wouldn’t work in most countries, as not all countries are small in area and have that high density, aren’t topographically homogeneous, or have advantageous locations that lead lots of trade and profit for a small population leading to urban infrastructure expenditure higher than other countries?

Drove by it once, and it seems like it’s planned out pretty well with bike lanes and other aspects in a really suburbia region.
That's it. Just feeling down about not being able to keep up with cost of living in the Bay Area. A planners salary isn't nearly enough to be ok and own a home in pretty much any part of the Bay, let alone the parts I would be happy living in. This is made worse by having high healthcare costs for chronic conditions. Leaving is an option but a very unattractive one because my family and friends are all here.  


I just feel. Frustrated. I went to a "good" school did "good" internships followed a career path where I thought I'd make a difference and have just ended up not making enough money to be ok where I want to be and not even making much of a difference anyway. I wish there was more education about what careers are actually like in school, rather than just an academic study of planning and environmental issues. The gulf between working in this field and studying it is ENORMOUS and I was definitely naive about salaries.  


I am feeling stuck about how to translate my experience into something higher paying without taking on a huge amount of debt for some kind of grad degree.
I'm wondering if I can get some advice from fellow planners on what it might take to make the switch from general land use planning to something more specialized like transportation.

I've been working as a generalist planner with a suburban jurisdiction for about two years now, mostly reviewing permits and processing planning applications and such. Prior to that I was in grad school, and I knew from the beginning that I was really interested in transportation planning. I took all the transportation classes I could, and I also did transportation research as a grad assistant throughout my grad program. I never had success applying to transportation positions back when I was in school, so I took this land use position because I just needed a job.

So far, I have no direct transportation planning experience, however I feel I have a firm grasp of how land use and transportation are interrelated. I'd really love to get into transportation planning, but I'm not sure how. I feel like unless I start back at entry level somewhere, it's going to be tough to break into the transportation field. Anyone who has made the jump from general municipal land use planning to transportation planning have any experience or advice they can share?
What I mean by arcologies are the self-sustained mega-cities that are super dense and have everything the citizens could possibly need in them. I’ve been hearing mixed opinions and I feel conflicted about them. On one hand they seem really impractical, but on the other, with proper planning, they seem like they could be pretty great to live in. Thoughts?


Originally, the "American Dream" was the idea that you could own a home in suburbia with kids, all on a good salary.

Now obviously Suburbia is a terrible place for good land use and public transit. And over the years, I think the "American Dream" has kind of turned into "I wish I could own a home or afford rent somewhere close to my place of work".

It all just feels incompatible. 

* The cities with great public transit where you can live a car-free lifestyle are way too expensive: so give up any ideas about affording rent without roommates and definitely give up any ideas of buying a house.
* The places where you can actually afford to move to are rural areas with no public transit, where you must drive everywhere. And most jobs in rural areas do not pay enough to even live there.

In the US, it really feels like the only places outside of major cities with decent jobs, transportation and land use are college towns. 


I see neighborhoods that are next to one another where the roads do not connect to one another directly and it requires residents to drive or walk along the stroad in order to get to the neighborhood that is next to it.

This causes a lot of traffic to be on the arterial roads on either side of these neighborhoods as there is no other access to these neighborhoods.

I have seen one larger neighborhood which has multiple through roads giving easier access to residents while having access roads for the houses along these through roads, enabling the pedestrians and houses to be further from the cars going through the neighborhood.

Is this a good solution to support overloaded stroads? To build new neighborhoods with parallel routes to the arterials with big setbacks via access roads?
For context I’m the US. I’m learning Architecture with the goal of designing mixed using housing and other options that will appeal to people and make them vote for change. I want to go aboard to see some of them in person and live in a walkable community. Is there anywhere you would recommend?

Interesting things about South Korean cities

In Korean cities, even if the population density in the urbanized area exceeds 10,000 or 20,000, the streets feel very empty and blank.  
On the other hand, as overseas users know well, it is not common in foreign countries where the population density exceeds 10,000 of built areas density, but places where it exceeds 10,000 are really crowded and hectic like chaotic.  
Maybe that's why in Korea, people think of 10,000 as the population density of a ghost-like city, but for geography geeks in foreign communities, including Reddit, the population density of 10,000 is a symbolic indicator of crowding like sardines.  
What causes these extreme differences?

Hello everyone! I’m a professional urban planner from Alberta and my fiancée and I will be taking a week long trip to Quebec City and Montreal. 

While we’re planning to check out all the typical spots, I was wondering if anyone had any specific things to do or checkout that might tickle that urban planning/design side of my brain. 

Whether they’re modern or historic, I’d love to hear some ideas!
Hi r/urbanplanning,

I have a 2nd interview for a civil planning/drafting role coming up. I have a couple years of drafting experience with AutoCAD, but no professional planning experience (they're aware of this and I think it's expected for this role as it's entry level, I think they really want me for my drafting experience). The extent of my experience with planning is an environmental planning course that I took years ago in college, and tangentially related is an environmental law course I took around the same time. I am vaguely familiar with CUPs and zoning, but I am very out of practice regarding planning. Just curious if there's any general pointers you guys might have for me. Any basics I should absolutely be aware of? I appreciate your time.
So, I work at a company that manufactures HVAC systems and my company is putting a lot of effort into promoting environmental-friendliness, energy efficiency, and low carbon output.

I would like to see my company promoting these things not just within the company, but also within the city the company is located in. 

Things like: building more public transit, making better bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, and changing zoning codes. These are things that not only improve a city and its community but can also make cities more environmentally friendly. 

I feel like it would be beneficial for the company I work at because now they have a way of potentially decreasing carbon emissions not just within its manufacturing supply chain, but also within the community the factories and offices are located in. 

In addition, it could also improve safety for employees. Explanation: The company I work at owns several different buildings located near each other. There is the office, the laboratory, the storage building, the factory, and some others that I'm not sure about their name or purpose. There are roads that are between these buildings, and these roads are rough and have poor sidewalks, or no sidewalks at all. I think this is an issue because employees regularly travel between buildings, and there is very little infrastructure for these employees to safely cross these roads or walk along them. When I first started working at this company I was given a tour of the company's buildings, and during the tour, we frequently had to talk on the shoulder of the road to walk between buildings. This was because many of the roads didn't have sidewalks, and it made no sense to drive because the buildings were very close to one another. Granted, these roads have very little vehicle traffic on them, but it still looks and feels very inconvenient for the employees. 

I'm currently a member of my local "StrongTowns" chapter, and StrongTowns is an organization that advocates for building better pedestrian infrastructure. If I want the company I work at to sponsor groups like StrongTowns, who would I have to talk to to make that more likely? 

At a minimum, it would be nice to see my company send a letter to the city government asking for better pedestrian pathways between the company's buildings so we won't have to walk on the shoulder of the road anymore. 
I'm interested in how we select different routes from a location to another in a city, especially when walking and biking. There are obviously many aspects to how routes are selected, including attractiveness and livelihood of the surroundings, landmarks, accessibility, traffic flow, shelter, safety etc.

I've noticed I'll often walk a certain route A to go to work, grocery store, library etc. and take a route B back home that is at least slightly different. Usually the routes are of similar length. I'll almost never take route B to go there and route A to return home. The same applies to my family members. 

I suspect other people orientate like this as well, or are we the only ones? Any thoughts on this? Is it somehow natural to select different routes there and back, but stay to the same routes if there are no obvious reasons to deviate from these routes, such as roadworks?
The recent post about Not Just Bikes made me wonder about how to incorporate activism into a planning job. It seems like the response from professionals is that they generally agree with Strong Towns and Not Just Bikes on policy, but that these media are not practical in our reality in the United States. And people seemed to think that these media are preaching to the choir and they are too blunt and patronizing to the ill-informed to change minds. Do I have that right as a general consensus? 

So I ask, for those that work in the planning profession:

Do you incorporate activism (such as new urbanist, multi-modal, and sustainable) principals in your work? 

What opportunities can you do this when you:
1) work for a municipality? 
2) work for a consultant? 
3) work for an architect? 
4) work for a like-minded developer? 

Which of those options might be a better career path to pursue for a fresh MURP grad?

How does the geometry of a 15 minute city work, since you can cover *much* less land area walking/biking than in a car? (the area of a circle is proportional to radius squared, so the distance covered by traveling gives superlinear increase in reachable land)

For example: assuming driving is 5x faster than walking, a 15 minute driving radius covers *25x more* area than a 15 minute walk. So, a walking-oriented neighborhood would need to be 25x more dense than a driving one to deliver the same population and services. And that level of density isn't generally feasible.

What's the flaw in this argument? Is there any literature that addresses this?

Edit: I framed this incorrectly by using 15 minute cities. I'm not asking whether it's feasible, but pointing out that getting equivalent population and services walking instead of driving is difficult to achieve because of the geometry and densities. For example, the amount of things I can reach in a 15 minute drive in my suburb would be hard to match in a 15 minute walkable neighborhood. So, some sacrifice is made in the '15 minute' city.
Hi, everyone! I have an interview tomorrow for a planning intern opportunity at a city.

I have been preparing questions to ask them at the end of my interview specific to the city but am worried I will become nervous and possibly forget some things I want to ask. 

Would it be a good idea to bring these questions written down just so I can reference them when I am asked if I have any questions for them? Or is this generally frowned upon? 

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!

Urban and transport planners as they exist right now are a part of the unelected bureaucracy for their respective cities and counties. Since they're apart of the bureaucracy it makes sense that urban planning efforts would be stymied by the sheer weight of it all. 

So, that got me thinking: what if  (along with giving them more executive powers) urban/transportation planners were a part of elected office?

 In my region, I could see some charismatic individuals running for that office on a platform of doing things like creating legally binding master plans, building walkable downtowns for suburbs that don't have them, building an elevated rail network for Detroit and it's inner suburbs, capping the Lodge freeway and turning it into a rail corridor, merging SMART, DDOT, and AATA buses into a single authority, etc, etc.

I think a switch to elected office would be for the better because it would require people like NIMBYs to contend with the wider electorate in order to shape cities and counties.

Do you agree? If not, I'd be curious to know why
MI planning law allows cities that had a population between 2.7k-2.8k on Sept 1, 2008 to have three non resident PC members, compared to most every other unit of government only allowed one. Does anyone know of a city in the state today utilizing this law, and/or if it was specifically created for that city and why?

Planning Enabling Act, 125.31815(4), states: 

“Members of a planning commission shall be qualified electors of the local unit of government, except that the following number of planning commission members may be individuals who are not qualified electors of the local  unit of government but are qualified electors of another local unit of government:
(a) 3, in a city that on September 1, 2008 had a population of more than 2,700 but less than 2,800.”

I am a Planner and have been for about 5 years now. One aspect I enjoy the most is finding loopholes in State and local policy and ordinance to further what I consider to be public good. For example, finding loopholes that increase affordable housing in areas not typically considered. I'd offer specific examples but it'd probably result in doxing myself and I'd prefer to avoid that. The planning community is a small one comparatively.

Is there a particular field of planning that focuses on this type of work? Is this just... Consulting? Or is there a more specific name for this type of job?

Let me know! Thanks!
Have some questions. Are there any cities that have banned hostile architecture. If not, what would you include in a policy to ban hostile architecture in your city?

Edit for clarification: I am asking more for specific uses of hostile architecture, policies, etc. more than an outright ban. I think that some uses of hostile architecture do provide safety, but many just harm unhoused individuals and disabled individuals.
Currently doing research on how zoning regulation can help mitigate the urban heat island effect. I am looking for zoning regulations in cities that have an urban heat island overlay/district. Anyone know a city I can refer to?
Thanks!

Edit: thanks everyone! I love the urban planning community :)
In general, what do you think is the best way to do parking reform in a typical American context:

1. Replace parking minimums with maximums
2. Eliminate minimums, but do not implement any maximums in their place (i.e. let the market decide how much parking is needed)
3. Some hybrid of the two options above

Discuss.

Seems like most urban planners agree that more emphasis on walking and bikes and less on cars and roads is a good idea, so what the heck is stopping us from doing this?

Edmonton Alberta is a city that's being developed, and it's going through the same cancerous urban sprawl. Thousands of acres of dense single family housing and all the stores literally a 2 hour walk away. Zero bikeability.

Why are neighbourhoods being built like this? Why is nothing changing, or at least changing slowly? If we're going to build the same stupid suburbs as before, at least make it walkable? 

Why does it seem like the only urban planners that care about logic and sustainablility are on the internet? Is it laws, education issues?

Tldr:most development happening currently is unsustainable and nothing's changing, why?

[According to an excerpt from The Geography of Transport Systems](https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter8/transportation-urban-form/average-commuting-time/), the reason why Asian and European countries have longer commute times is mostly due to having a higher transit and walking mode share as both are slower than car travel on average. I understand that walking + transit conveys other benefits like reduced obesity and better per capita environmental outcomes, but it kinda irks me if it is true that it makes for slower commutes even if everything is closer.

My Californian city wants to build more housing, but every developer wants to build massive suburban style homes on lots that are 6,000-10,000 sq ft (partly because of zoning). But the city also doesn't want to deny these projects because we need new housing. Is it worth it to deny these projects even if they would be providing around 300-500 units each over a couple years, but would take up around 150-300 acres of land that could otherwise be used way more efficiently? We're also no San Francisco or Los Angeles so it's not like developers are clammoring to build here. As a result we want to keep the few that we do get.
i feel like a grid pattern is pretty conducive to walkability, but most suburbs built today have really convoluted street layouts. are they just unsavable?
As an aspiring urban planner, I really look forward to making the world a better place by improving the built-environment. However, I'm curious to know how much progress planners are actually able to make. I worry that factors like NIMBY, government regulations, and corporate backlash will make planner contributions very minimal.
is it just the CIP (canadian institute of planners) orrrrr
I understand that job availability and poverty are major factors in determining crime in a neighborhood, but has anyone considered how urban design may be linked to crime. 

For example, in neighborhoods with lots of alleys, poor lighting and short cuts' criminals can get away without police catching them. Also more spread out towns have less people looking  out for their neighbor. I'm also tempted to say, that the desolate cookie cutter homes, have a depressing phycological/depersonalizing  aspect to it?   

If anyone can find any study's to post links to, that would be great.
something I've been thinking lately. US population is always increasing and urban and the first few rings of suburban housing costs are skyrocketing. this is pushing more and more people farther out from their work. Many cities aren't adding more housing to meet demand and this is true of many first ring suburbs as well.

&#x200B;

The US population is only going to increase and the above will continue and what does everyone think will happen for people to be able to get to work in a reasonable amount of time. Transit is going to be obscenely expensive and time consuming to build new lines through existing towns.

&#x200B;

Will companies continue to only have offices in centralized city CBD's. Will remote work expand in the coming years or will companies open up more suburban offices like they had decades ago except these will be smaller remote offices. 
I'm curious to what extent suburbia is an American phenomenon. The post war baby boom history of suburbia is uniquely American, but what equivalents are there in other countries? Bonus points for surprising or off the beaten path answers.
I know that Esri has partnered with APA in the past, but I can’t find anything specifically about the 2023 conference.
In his book * Dream Hoarders: How the American Upper Middle Class Is Leaving Everyone Else in the Dust, Why That Is a Problem, and What to Do About It*, Brookings Institution Senior Fellow Richard Reeves argues that the gap between the upper middle class - the top 20% of Americans by income -  and the rest of Americans is widening. 

> As Reeves shows, the growing separation between the upper middle class and everyone else can be seen in family structure, neighborhoods, attitudes, and lifestyle. Those at the top of the income ladder are becoming more effective at passing on their status to their children, reducing overall social mobility. The result is a fracturing of American society along class lines, not just an economic divide. Upper-middle-class children become upper-middle-class adults.

https://www.brookings.edu/books/dream-hoarders/

One of the solutions that Reeves proposes is to pass zoning reform. Current zoning laws, he argues, prevent children from lower income households from being able to access good K-12 educational opportunities that would better prepare them for higher education (college) and better help them climb the social ladder.

> Exclusionary zoning is a form of “opportunity hoarding” by the upper middle class, a market distortion restricting access to a scarce good (in this case, land), that restricts opportunities (such as good schools) to other children. Those upper middle class voters who oppose more mixed-use housing in their own neighborhoods are what I call “Dream Hoarders,” keeping elements of the American Dream for themselves at the expense of others.

This idea has been in social discourse for a while now: this Atlantic article titled “Schools are more segregated today than during the late 1960s” was published in 2012.

https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/06/schools-are-more-segregated-today-than-during-the-late-1960s/258348/

What urban policy solutions can be implemented to remedy the problem of de facto school segregation, help children of low income families get better educational opportunities, and allow for more social mixing and integration of kids from diverse class and racial backgrounds?
Basically the title. I'm looking to transition out of transport planning in the US and move abroad. The problem is that my target countries - Belgium or the Netherlands - are not really known for their private practices; rather, most work is done in-house, and it's tough to figure out where they advertise. Does anyone have experience with this?

Thanks!

A bit of a tactical ~~urbanism~~ moderation trial to help concentrate common questions around career and education advice.

**The current soft trial will:**

\- To the extent possible, refer users posting these threads to the scheduled posts.

\- Test the waters for aggregating this sort of discussion

\- Take feedback (in this thread) about whether this is useful

**If it goes well:**

\- We would add a formal rule to direct conversation about education or career advice to these threads

\- Ask users to help direct users to these threads

**Goal:**

To reduce the number of posts asking somewhat similar questions about Education or Career advice and to make the previous discussions more readily accessible.
What is the type of development where a block of townhouses faces the side yard and the side of the block fronts the street? There was a post awhile ago about some city where there are many and not liked.

Edit. Thanks reflect25 - they are "slot houses". 

I’d like to know how to prepare for my second interview as I’m unsure how to stand out after meeting the interviewers a second time. Actually to clarify, the first interview I went for was a Planning Tech 1 job (for the county) about a month ago but I got a call informing me that I didn’t get the job because they decided to hire internally, but they did enjoy my interview and invited me to apply for Planning Tech 2 position that had just become available. I think this is because I have my bachelors degree in urban planning and because the area is more rural and not a large city, none of their other candidates actually had a degree in planning specifically and he said he believes I could potentially start at the planning tech 2 position instead.

But, they are doing the entire interview process over of course with new candidates who have applied to the job so there is no guarantee someone more qualified or interesting isn’t gonna be interviewing. How can I prepare, and how can I stand out as a candidate especially since they’ve already met me, and I’m not sure what else new I can tell them.

Here's a specific example with my link, related to where I am living.  On one side of the fence quiet, residential suburbia, on the other side of fence is a Walmart.

Now this Walmart is at a corner that includes an Aldis, a Wegmans and a Target.  That is to say, it is a traffic nightmare for the area.  Now to me, giving pedestrians/bikers a back way in  is a cheap and easy way to mitigate some of that traffic.  But there in lies that  fence.  And it's not the first time I have seen such a fence separating residential neighborhoods and big box stores.  I get not wanting thru traffic, but why do these places not have a carve out for pedestrians?
I'm not an urban planner, and I have no aspirations to do urban planning professionally. That said, every summer I try to learn a bit about a new topic. So I think it'd be interesting to learn some basic principles of urban planning and think about how communities are designed.

Are there any approachable introductory texts that I should look for?
I recently heard about the level of traffic stress (LTS) scale when it comes to bicycle infrastructure. As a confident, but concerned cyclist who has also had experience working with children in bike related jobs, I found this scale eye opening and fascinating for rating different levels of bicycle infrastructure.

For instance, streets with no bicycle infrastructure are a mixed bag. Some are moderate traffic volumes (more than the occasional car, but definitely not a stream of traffic) and speed (probably not more than 50km/h). The thing is, while not my favourite kind of street, I both bike there and have felt comfortable taking kids there (5-10 yrs). I certainly wouldn't take a four year old who barely knows how to ride a bike there, but a six year old can handle it with adult supervision.

However according to the LTS scale, this would be either LTS 2 or LTS 3, which supposedly means it's only suitable for confident adult cyclists. Not only have I taken kids there (by instruction from my higher ups no less), but this street is well used by cyclists including a number of fair weather cyclists (much busier on sunny days and in spring and summer). So I find it hard to believe that only 5-7% of the population would find this kind of street unsafe and incomfortabke to bike on and totally unsuitable for children.

Have I just missed something about the LTS scale? Or do I live in a place with a uniquely daring population?
Hello, I'm not sure this is the right place to post this question but I have an issue with a power sub station that borders my property.

We purchased our home 3 years ago and have been working to make it a property we can be proud to own and live in. One issue we have been facing, however is the sub station. Currently there is a 6 foot tall chain link fence separating our properties where on the 3 other sides there are 12 foot tall privacy fences. I was told by a neighbor that SCEG had to put up those privacy fences years ago due to Richland county ordinances and zoning laws but they weren't sure why it wasn't done with my property. This was done over a decade ago and have been unable to contact the previous owner.

We would like to have the privacy fence added to obstruct the view of the substation from our back yard and contacted SCEG about it. After some talking SCEG told us that because the sub station pre-existed the most recent zoning ordinance, the property was grandfathered into compliance and therefore no changes are required.

This was over a year ago. Just last week, however, they started to update and improve the substation. they put in a new set of transformers and two new relay stations. This has resulted in an even greater eyesore from our property. I called Richland County's zoning board that the support staffer I spoke with told me that without changes in actual square footage in property or changes to parking this wouldn't change their status or force them to comply with updated ordinances.

It seems unfair to me that a public utility can refuse a privacy fence claiming that the structure predates the rules and then drastically increase its size without having to follow zoning regulations.

If anyone has any insight into issues like these, or can point me towards resources that can help I would appreciate it. I would go to the city counsel for help but the substation isn't in my city district (it's just on the other side of the line), and it's unlikely that county counsel will care about a single home owner going up against one of the largest utility companies in the state.

Thank you.
I’m an entry-level engineer who has found myself frustrated with the engineering field, and I am thinking about a career shift into urban planning. 

I’ve heard it said “you can get an urban planner job with a bachelors in engineering no problem”, but I’m not so sure. It seems like every urban planner has a masters degree and that’s what you need to be competitive.

My questions are,

1. Any advice for me in a job search? Is a masters a must, or do I just need to be patient? What education/experience did you have before getting hired as a planner?

2. Would a senior planner see the value in hiring someone with an engineering degree, since I could market myself as more capable/eager to bring collaboration between the planning and engineering departments? (The two often being at odds, in my experience). Is this something I should cling to, or ignore?

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!

Many top lists of the most walkable cities globally almost always only rank European and North American cities. As the world goes beyond the NATO-states, I am wondering which cities deserve to be top ranked too?

In my urban planning class the professor, who is from St. Paul, MN, brought up Eau Claire and La Crosse, Wisconsin for examples of urban planning. One thing noticed is that La Crosse is in a valley with the Mississippi River to the west, and bluffs to east. Meaning North/South is the only way to expand.  Also making a better way for thru traffic to pass thru a lot harder to build. While Eau Claire can expand any direction.  Class discussion kind of leaned towards Eau Clarie is better designed for the cards they have because:

1.Thru traffic goes around the city (bypasses all directions around the city).

2. Little to no stroads.

3. Fair public transport (by American standards)

4. Adding on to bike paths.

But La Crosse has:

1. More mixed used areas
2. Shorter distances between things.
3. More compact downtown.
4. Also a good public transport system/ bike paths

What other ways could we narrow this down? The professor told us reddit would be a good way to get a better answer.

Edit: He gave us three ways of looking at how to decide:

* Strong towns approach 
* or Car Centric approach
* or Somewhere in between
Underground rail provides all the benefits of elevated rail, without the often disruptive nature of constructing huge pylons of concrete and running a rail line on top of it. They're more discreet, blend the urban environment better, and do not present any accessibility challenges that elevated rail doesn't. So, other than the cost of tunneling through often hard to dig through terrain, are there any benefits to elevating rail, instead of digging under?

An interview with Urban planner Veronica Davis, who talks about her book Inclusive Transportation, the role of equity in street design, and the role of expertise in community engagement.
I don't if it's true or not, but still interesting. What do you guys think? Can this be applied to the greater US as a whole?


It seems like we're not building enough housing in the United States. Yet in the past we were able to build and grow cities fairly easily. Similarly we were able to build infrastructure like roads, bridges, rail-lines and more..   
What has happened or changed recently that's caused our cities to have such growing pains? (Slow growth, NIMBYs being allowed to block development, zoning creating issues, sluggish progress, etc..) 

Why weren't these such big issues in the past? 
My town engineer proposed an aggressive plan to make the streets safer and more bike friendly. The council was mostly displeased with the thought of losing parking spots, saying “people who use bikes as a primary mode of transport don’t exist”. I wrote an email saying I did in fact exist, and fully supported the removal of parking spaces. 

The council member most opposed to the plan reached out asking if I’d like to talk. I’d like to take the opportunity to bring a solid list of sources and ideally photos! I work in engineering, but not urban planning. I like to follow the rule of “Tell them what you’re gunna tell them. Tell them. Tell them what you told them”. 

By American standards our town is quite walkable already, and I genuinely believe I could change his mind. I’d like to make the case that pedestrian friendly infrastructure is better for people with disabilities (I have some family members who use mobility aids but I’d love to hear from someone in the community directly!), better for local businesses, and better for town finances. 

Can anyone point me to any entry level sources to spread the word? My gut approach would be to summarize and screencap some city beautiful and not just bikes videos but I’d love to come in with some academic backing!

Thanks!
I switched from public sector current planner (15 yrs experience) to private sector recently. I am subcontracting with an independent planner who has been very old school for a long time. We accepted a job updating code for a small town. Now we have a ton of experience between us, but not in writing graphic heavy code, so my question may be novice, but I'm too scared to ask other collogues! 

What's the rule of thumb with using existing / published / adopted codes in a new code? I'm not trying to pull and entire code, 100%, but if its not broke, why fix it? I understand context, etc. But I cant get a read on reusing graphics from an adopted code. Is it OK?? Exact definitions? Detailed rules for growth like additions to non-conforming buildings? Those kind of details. 

If I know "Town A" did something perfectly and has THE perfect graphic for it, can I use it for "Town B's" code?

Plz don't shoot me for this question. I realize its the kind you quietly ask your mentor....

“Unless federal rules and standards are reformed, it is likely that much of the half a trillion dollars in federal formula transportation funds under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will be spent by states undermining environmental justice, worsening climate change, and eroding public health,” said Michael Replogle, founder and senior advisor to the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy and the lead author of the letter.

Hello, Ladies and Gentlemen!

Recently, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/14rhmzw/an_idea_for_a_revolution_in_urban_transport/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) here about the possibility of using a flexible route microbus taxi as the main form of public transport. The comments contained a lot of constructive criticism. In particular, user u/sniperman357 made a very serious counterargument. They pointed out that daily demand is inconsistent and has two pronounced peaks: a morning and an evening one, with a slump in between. Conventional urban transport copes with increased demand simply by having a large reserve capacity in the cabins.

Such a solution is not suitable for my idea, as increasing the number of passengers in the cabin would mean more frequent stops for the microbus and, as a result, a decrease in its average speed. If this speed drops, the microbus taxi will no longer be as attractive, and a significant percentage of people would prefer their personal cars, undermining the logical structure upon which my idea stands.

Having a constant large fleet of circulating microbuses is not a solution either. If during peak periods microbuses carry an optimal average of 5 passengers, then between peaks this number will drop to 2-3, making trips too expensive. Attracting additional drivers during the morning and evening surge is also not a solution, as the surges do not last long and both of them do not fit into one work shift.

I must admit, when I realized this problem, I wasn't sure I could solve it and even prepared for the possibility that my bus taxi idea might actually fail. However, I managed to find a solution, which I'll link to, so that you have the opportunity to think about the problem on your own - after all, there are plenty of certified transport planners here. I hope you enjoy solving this little problem :)

Do certain states have issues attracting and retaining good forward thinking planners?

I've also noticed at least one state that doesn't seem to want to hire people from out of state, do you think this creates stronger planning?
Hey, I'm working on a project related to city planning and transportation. We've spoken to a few people in public services and urban development to understand their needs for building smarter cities. A lot of them wish to use data for better decision-making, but it seems like they're not doing it yet. I'd like to know what you think about this.   
Idea 1: There's not enough good-quality data available.  
Idea 2: The data is available, but they're not sure how to use it.  
Idea 3: They have the data and know how to use it, but other issues like politics are in the way.  
Idea 4: We're already making decisions based on data and current plans are heading in the right direction.

I was driving down Alcatraz Ave. in Berkeley and Oakland (the border crosses it several times). On Alcatraz Avenue you get a dead on view of Alcatraz Island. It seems unusual that the street is named for what you can see along it, do folks know of other such streets?
Do I just call the city, have them say 'yeah, sure', then start organizing my neighbors to start calling and writing our elected leaders, etc.?

Or maybe start with my city councilperson?

Thanks for any ideas.

...also, i worry about community opposition. not just because, say, nearby houses might not want the lights, so might try to kill the project, but also, i try to be a good hippie, so i'm wondering what objections folks might have, how they can be remedied, etc.
I just stumbled across this group. I have a question for you. Population growth in the US has been less than 1% per year for some time now. 2022 was substantially less than 1%. In light of those facts, why do I see so many new houses being built? I live in Chester County, PA and I frequently visit Horry County, SC. In both of those locations, I see so many new houses being built. I don’t think there are that many dwellings going out of use each year. With our low amount of population growth in the US, why are there so many new homes?
As a somewhat recent college grad (B.S. History 2022) who is heavily interested in urban planning, I know volunteering can be a good way to gain experience and stand out on applications for both grad schools and future jobs in the field. I don't have any direct experience with urban planning and currently work in a prison coordinating transportation and medical appointments for incarcerated individuals.

My question is this: What types of volunteering opportunities would directly correlate or run alongside the field of urban planning?

I'm having some trouble finding many volunteering opportunities in general, let alone ones I feel would be relevant to the field. I live in a small to medium sized city in the upper Midwest which is fairly red and not very diverse for reference.

I'm curious to hear about your experiences with volunteering and how it helped get you to where you are today, either as a planner or someone on the path to getting there.

Any advice or knowledge helps because I don't know what I'm doing :)
Hi all,

I’m a final yr bachelors student planning on continuing my studies with a Master in Urban/ Rural Planning.

I was wondering before I commit myself to this career on what the potential is for travel as a planner/ working overseas (on a visa perhaps). 

Obviously for overseas work policy is very region-based so that’s a bit difficult for working as a planner, but then maybe there are other relevant (well-paying) jobs that would be easy to shift into as a planner?

Anyone have any words of advice, experience?

Thank you!
I’ve worked with two cities and one county. I’ve gotten to Associate Planner and after being there for some time I got bored. I no longer feel that I am in Planning for what I went into it for. The community engagement isn’t there, I’m not learning anything new, communities are only thought about when the code updates come around. I work in a conservative city so I do not want to get involved with their politics. I’ve never been anywhere but traditional planning.

Where do I go from here? 

I’m interested in tribal and environmental planning, but also debating on going back for my masters in public health. It took me two degree changes to get here and I feel like I’m not finding the thing that makes me proud of the work I’m doing while having an income that won’t leave me absolutely screwed in this economy. I feel like that’s not much to ask, but it really is apparently.

I have Floodplain experience, been the Shoreline administrator, have GIS experience.  

I’m really let down by this field.

I have noticed that several counties have encouraged suburban development and even apartments in some places at the detriment of agricultural land and with large infrastructure investments in roads.

What is your opinion on county development goals? 

My first instinct is that the county should try to cluster development and get them incorporated as quickly as possible to get rid of the cost of maintenance while still pulling in income taxes and property taxes. However, one of my superiors in the county planning department has pointed out that it's hard for the smaller communities to incorporate and that they don't have the capabilities to manage their own affairs and have to hire out to the county so it just adds extra bureaucracy.
Surely the loads of very intelligent civil engineers are smart enough to do something different if it is really a problem, so why aren't they if it's such an issue?
What are the state-wide TOD initiatives American states have? New Jersey for instance, has the Transit Village initiative that has transformed several of Jersey’s downtowns into walkable places where you can live, shop, dine and take the train to work! I feel it has done a great job in NJ, and I first hand have seen how good density is getting slowly added to downtowns!
I've always been struck by the number of random little parks and playgrounds located immediately next to major roadways in my area. I presume this happens due to cost reasons--the land is cheap and the private ownership interest is correspondingly low.

We all have different preferences as planners, but I’m curious to know if everyone is happy with the city they’ve landed in for their career and their home. And what are your dream cities to work and live in?


Background: I’ve worked in a small but about-to-boom town outside of Raleigh NC (exhausting working with anti-urban attitudes and zero resources but loved living in Raleigh) and an urbanized county in Central FL (more resources but weird FL individualist values even from the urbanists, plus I HATE tropical humidity).
all the money in the world but there are no retiro, english garden, or hyde park in similar size cities in america (dallas, houston, atlanta, miami, kansas city, phoenix). maybe older places like nyc, st louis, sf, chicago. even mid size euro cities like stockholm and zaragoza seems to do better.
Question to planners from/familiar with Australia: there has been a lot of discussion and analysis of North American (especially US) car dependency, but rarely of Australian/NZ car dependency. Why did Australia become as car dependent as it has. 

Are there also any other resources on this topic?
I am looking for the best books or resources available on urban planning because it is a subject that has increasingly become important to me, especially when it comes to understanding the differences and possible reasons that led to planning a city in one way or another and to learn about the best practices and designs for a city.
So I was offered a city planner position for a city that is less than 20,000 people. The COL is relatively low compared to other parts of California. The offer is $90k + benefits. I have 2 years experience.




Hi, I'm a second-semester Architecture student, and I've just finished this semester's project which focused on urban design. In regard to this, I've been thinking quite a lot about what would make the perfect urban city design. If you were to sit down and draw a new city, on a "blank slate" almost like developments in the United Arab Emirates or China, what would you do?

Being a Dane myself, i was naturally attracted to the literature of Jan Gehl, and especially the book "Soft City" by David Sim, which proposes that "Dense-low" architecture, like 4-5 story buildings with inner courtyards, creates a better environment for urban living, much like what exists in Copenhagen, or perhaps something like Barcelona. In addition to this, I've seen quite a lot of criticism toward car-centric design and grid layouts.

Okay, my question, sorry for the long preface.

Is there any literature or research on alternatives to grid layouts? Is there perhaps some way to plan with reason and be systematic, without ending up with a monotonous city layout?  (also because Cityskylines 2 is releasing soon, and i might wanna test it out)

Thanks for reading :)I look forwards to your responses, best regards.
As an urban planner, do you get to play a part in that process, or does someone else make those decisions? If you do have a say, how often do such opportunities come up?   


Thank you for any information you are able to give <3 It's a bit difficult to find specific information on this kind of thing
It's hard to ignore that a good percentage of Soviet city blocks look like massive castles or forts. Was that just a coincidence, or did they design them that way at least partially in order to make them act as easily defendable strong points in case of a war?
From the 1880s to 1940s, Atlantic City was a major city and resort destination that draws many comparisons to the Las Vegas of today. Over the years, other cities caught up, and eventually, all hell broke loose when Hurricane Sandy destroyed large chunks of the city including the beloved boardwalk, and then Donald Trump bankrupted the entire city with one casino. Thousands of people lost their jobs and homes.  
Ever since then, the city has become poorer by the month with thousands moving out.  
More recently, some developers have begun plans to rebuild and repurpose parts of the city into its former glory. After reading some I began to think about the concepts I've seen for environmentally friendly architecture. How cool would it be to implement some of those ideas into a city that could become the Las Vegas of the East? And given the city is located right on the water, it would also be a great place to establish oceanic research centers.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_  
I don't live in New Jersey but I think the ongoing idea to somehow give Atlantic City a rebirth so to speak is really cool and I'd honestly just like to hear some of the pros from this subreddit talk about your thoughts/ideas and even concerns about all this.
Hi! I’m a college student working on my undergrad. I’m majoring in Geography and minoring in Urban Studies. I’ll also be working on a GIS micro-credential.

Would you recommend starting with the LEED Green Associate certification or the Congress for New Urbanism Accreditation? 

I would ideally like to get both, but for now I can only fit one into my schedule. Then someday I’ll go for the LEED AP-ND and the AICP.

# A New Kind of Public Transport.

I'm delighted to greet all readers and participants of r/urbanplanning, professionals, enthusiasts, and everyone passionate about city planning. My name is Sergey Kovalenko, I'm a mathematician. During my latest research ([https://habr.com/en/articles/738864/](https://habr.com/en/articles/738864/)), I came to a surprising discovery.

We have the technology to create public transport that requires absolutely no transfers. Moreover, such transport would be fast and comfortable enough to compete with personal cars, while also being mass-produced to the extent that the cost per trip would be comparable to a regular city bus or subway. The most amazing part? Nothing extraordinary is required: all we need is a suitable number of minibuses and a slightly more intricate network of routes than what we currently use.

In a grid-based city, these buses would run within areas similar to a [Greek "Γ," following a flexible route](https://preview.redd.it/db8dd4aw9z9b1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63eac31862c4a88e9ad79ace9aa043b055de2317). For any two intersections, there will always be a Γ-shaped corridor to which they both belong, meaning that the buses running along this corridor can reach from one intersection to the other without any transfers.

# My Vision for the Vehicle.

As for the minibuses, they should be specifically designed to comfortably accommodate a maximum of 8-12 people. Personally, I envision them as electric, low-floor vehicles with sliding doors and a small platform in the center, somewhat like [Eolo by Krassi Dimitrov](https://preview.redd.it/0tsihp86az9b1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=059398ce4fbf907ac76e203519373dc6ee0a8c88).

# How the Service Works from a User's Perspective.

To use the service, you would need to reach any nearby intersection and use an application on your mobile phone or a video terminal installed at the stop to indicate your destination. If you struggle with this, a live consultant can assist you through the video terminal. Within just 2-3 minutes after you've specified your destination, the right bus for you will arrive. This bus will take you directly to your destination, and a special alert system will ensure you don't miss your stop.

# So, what characteristics would this kind of public transport have?

In my estimates, I used a grid-based city model and got the following results for a typical metropolis like New York or Los Angeles ([https://habr.com/en/articles/740162/](https://habr.com/en/articles/740162/)):

1. The average number of passengers in the salon is around 5, with the highest number (about 10) when the bus is near the corner of its Γ-shaped corridor.
2. The average journey time on a bus taxi, including waiting time at the stop, is no more than 1.5 times longer than a trip by personal car.
3. Waiting time at the stop is 1-3 minutes.
4. The cost of a trip is $3-4.

**The advantages of this approach include:**

1. Speed and comfort for users. This could reduce the average daily travel time by 10-15 minutes for a typical metropolis with 3-5 million inhabitants.
2. Due to point 1), the bus taxi is expected to pose serious competition to private cars. If a significant portion of those who previously used private cars switch to using the bus taxi, road traffic could significantly decrease (theoretically up to 5 times less).
3. As a result, traffic congestion should be eliminated, noise levels and exhaust emissions should decrease. A significant portion of street parking would become unnecessary, and the freed land could be used for parks, playgrounds, or construction.
4. Increased mobility for city residents would stimulate the city's economy and provide greater opportunities for shared use of its public goods.

# Invitation for Dialogue and Participation.

I would like to invite the r/urbanplanning community to join the discussion on my research. This idea has already sparked interesting discussions in r/transit [(link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/transit/comments/14fz0pf/an_idea_for_a_revolution_in_urban_transport/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and r/tacticalurbanism [(link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TacticalUrbanism/comments/14i2j81/an_idea_for_a_revolution_in_urban_transport/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and I'm eager to gain insights from your unique perspective in urban planning and design.

I should note that my work experience is closer to the field of computer science and was not directly related to urban planning, urbanism, sociology, or economics. Therefore, my vision of the problem may seem significantly simplified. I would greatly appreciate if experts from all these fields could join the discussion so we could together ponder whether my idea can be implemented in practice and how it can best be done.

Thank you in advance for your time and interest in my idea. Your thoughts and feedback are incredibly important to me. I hope that together we can help change public transportation for the better.
This idea tries to strike a balance between "local control" and the simple reality that we need a lot more housing in the most in-demand areas. The idea is roughly this:

Until any first-ring suburb reaches 70% the population density of its principal city, it cannot implement any exclusionary zoning such as SFH exclusivity, large lot sizes, etc. and must allow *regionally-appropriate* multifamily housing everywhere. Once that 70% threshold is reached, they'd have "done their part" so to speak and could go back to more exclusive zoning for a while. For second-ring suburbs, that threshold might be 50%. Third ring suburbs might be 30% (make up your own numbers here; these seem reasonable to me). Reevaluate every 5 years or as needed.  

For some context I looked at Boston, which borders 14 municipalities. Some are actually substantially *denser* than Boston proper and would need to do nothing (indeed there are four suburbs denser than Boston and several others already at the 70% mark). Others, though, are sparsely populated, *only 10-20% as dense*, while still enjoying all the same benefits of being near the city. They would be forced to allow a mix of appropriate local housing options. In Boston, this means triple deckers might be back on the menu, where now they are illegal. In Milwaukee it'd mean duplexes, etc. Crucially, no one is asking them to build super high-density towers or other types of housing that would greatly change the character of a place. 

The justification here is simple: if you live near a major city, which gives you access to jobs, entertainment, healthcare, airports, etc., you should expect to have plenty of neighbors, since a lot of other people also want those benefits. This is also more targeted and less top down than the statewide bills that seem popular these days, so it seems like it'd be that much easier to get through a state legislature. 
Some geographies  makes ever so common that large industry is hard to place, with a dimished number of suitable areas in the borders of the city.   
The case in point comes to a company that, while not the biggest, nets tens of percents of municipal taxes, but would need to be placed in an area that makes a direct acess arterial road from the industrial complex to the city unfeasible (there's still a highway, largely the single access point to the city).  


While it's a clear yes in short mid-term, it does create a mobility debt (which has in the past created a central mobility choke with a now indifferent business).  
I would like to put out some feelers and see if anyone has references on this kind of situation (im not a stakeholder, dont be alarmed)   

I’ve reached out to three of the offices of representatives who have sponsored the bill and have heard nothing. Shouldn’t they need actual renters voices or organizing?
I ask this question both in terms of the policy side and the building side. Not only are there very few cities that even allow for detached accessory dwelling units, but in the ones that do, there are far fewer being built than there should be, given market demand. 

I genuinely cannot figure it out. All the research I've done point to them being a really positive thing. 

* Increased density without demolition of existing structures
* Local control by local homeowners rather than corporate-landlord-owned apartment buildings (potentially leads to less gentrification too?)
* Decreased home values due to increased supply are not a worry for locals because they can simply choose to also build ADUs on their property to counteract any downward forces on their property value

I would love to know why detached accessory units have not seen wider adoption and what some shortcomings of them are that I haven't considered.
Hello urbanplanning, per the title, I am fairly new to NYC and I am looking for community and looking to get involved with like minded folks that enjoy bikes, trains, transit, urbanism, etc. What that would even look like, I am not sure. An advocacy group? just a regular meetup? I don't know, please let me know!
I have the opportunity to get an internship (planning + urbanism related)at a large private firm (think AECOM) for the fall semester. However, I also got an internship opportunity with the US Small Business Administration (non-planning related, public administration). Would choosing an experience (btw Public vs Private Sector) really affect the opportunities I get in the future? I am currently already doing a federal internship this summer and loved it so far. I definitely would go into planning when I graduate college in about a year.
I'm a junior planner barely a year into the job doing municipal and economic dev planning. Lately I'm getting made to write proposals for RFP's where before I was maybe formatting a senior planner's proposal to look nicer in InDesign.

Catch - ain't got a hot clue how to write succesful proposals from scratch. I did one half from scratch and half from looking at an older, similar proposal that won a different RFP before, but I'm looking for some pro tips outside of 'read carefully and address everything they're asking for'. 

Anyone got words of wisdom for the rookie? Appreciate it, thanks!
As I've become interested in urban planning discussions and learning, some of my frustration is that it can become a bit of a false dichotomy and polarized discussion.

That you must either enjoy super dense developments where everything is in one building, or you want car-centric isolation. Often a very strict city vs suburb dichotomy where cities are obviously superior.

And it's annoying to me because people are capable of liking **and** disliking different parts of development and living space rather than it being strictly either or. I would say I like walkable downtowns. I like having easy access to the city but I don't necessarily want to live in the city proper due to a desire for quiet at night.

But I also understand that cities are unnecessarily hated on due to stereotypes like crime rate and safety. You see how a lot of New Jerseyans hate on Newark because of preconceptions even though it's an underrated city.

To an extent, I understand that there's interconnected aspects to these discussions: in a lot of aspects, suburbs aren't sustainable. You can't have public transportation serving an efficient number of people if everyone is spread out.

I know it's the nature of the internet but it can be frustrating to hear "Hail this building where everything and everyone is in the same building, incredible efficient use of space." This is personal preference, but to me it feels a bit cold. And it feels like a railroading of preferences into **"This is the ideal."** I just feel like there should be a more nuanced spectrum.

&#x200B;
I know this might be a tad niche however I was wondering if anyone has some experience setting up their own private consulting business/ familiar with what it takes? If so any skills and experiences needed for the role. I am relatively new to the planning work force and want to keep my options open for the future as I gain more experience in the profession. A small firm practice seems to have its own level of rewarding work and I am curious to hear of anyone's experiences with it. 

There seems to be a good case to put through traffic on some sort of ring road/highway as opposed to a highway that leads straight through the city center so that city centers don’t get congestion and don’t suffer from noise and air pollution. It’d also just be more aesthetically pleasing. But to play devil’s advocate, I could imagine a person saying that it’s better for cities to have through traffic going through a city center because motorists have a more direct route to a destination on the opposite side of the city, and that trying to concentrate through traffic on a ring road will actually increase greenhouse gas emissions for many people because their VMT will increase due to having a less direct route. Is this argument true, or at least has some truth to it? Or is this statement false? Why or why not?
I’ve lived in the suburbs my whole life and I’m looking to move to somewhere in the US that has walkable areas that’s maybe not as popular as Chicago, San Fran, seattle, NYC

I’ve heard good things about Madison WI, eugene, parts of Raleigh

I was watching the latest Adam Something video and he points out that some things are subsidized which are net good, whereas some things are subsidized which are a net cost, namely free parking.  In most cases however, it is not the business and residential owners who directly want to subsidize parking - it is mandated by local government through parking minimums.  Transit is also almost always subsidized, but the funding for that subsidy comes from general revenues.

This lead me to a thought: what if the cost of parking were directly tradeable against revenue to subsidize transit?  My concept is that when building a commercial or residential building, the developer would have the option to "buy out" their minimum parking requirement at a suitable per-space rate, and that revenue would be put in a transit funding lockbox.  If the rate is set appropriately at slightly below the development and maintenance cost of a parking spot, this would allow developers to choose the mix of parking vs additional functional space that they find suitable for the type of project - rather than government taking a broad-brush approach and setting a strict yes/no threshold.

With current parking minimum waivers or removal, the government does not get much (financially) in return - which contributes to the fights over these policies.  This approach would compensate the government with transit funding which wouldn't have to be obtained elsewhere (another contentious issue) and provides broad benefits.  In some way, this could be sold as, for example, a parking-less apartment building still paying their way for the transportation system in general and not just getting a "free ride" using surrounding parking areas (whether the latter is true or not).

So, has this been tried anywhere?  Does the community think it could be feasible?  What issues would have to be addressed?
Got my degree in city planning 2 years ago along with a minor in sustainability and a technical certificate in GIS, did an internship and got real world experience. I still haven’t found a job. i have applied to every municipality and city in my area, half never respond and ignore the emails and reach outs i send, the rest send rejections and when i reach out for advice on continuing my career they get ignored. 

I’ve gotten one response so far and they told me “congratulations on your degree, if you want to pursue a career you should volunteer somewhere”. (I have a 9-5 with rent to pay and cannot do any volunteering plus, i already have my bachelors degree and did an internship for experience) I would reach back out to the city i interned for but i no longer live in that state and i’m in no financial ability to move back at any time soon. 

If anyone here has advise for how to get work let me know and if anyone is thinking of pursuing this degree please keep my experience in mind.

PSA to mods this isn’t a question about college
Especially if they were intentionally designed to be dense to reduce infrastructure and transportation costs.

I know this is a hopeless hypothetical, but it’s fun to imagine about 🍻
This is the previous thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/14bo3ke/finally_got_the_job_i_wanted_out_of_grad_school/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

Just thought I would follow up. I voiced my concerns to my boss and told her that I wanted to resign. She did convince me to stay, but an hour later I had another panic attack while working from home and ultimately chose to resign. I know I can do the job, I look back at the job description and my time there and know I am qualified and have the skills and experience. But I did not have the support from my supervisor in the sense of training, or any leeway of having questions without a condescending response. I probably wouldn't care about that if I was not in a mentally vulnerable state, but it is what it is.

At the end of the day, it was a mental health issue. I am posting this not for myself, but just to spread the word. I am moving forward to receive therapy and medication. I don't think this is a planner-specific thing, but to anyone who reads this, please listen to your mind and body and get yourself right before other people are depending on you. I have had issues my entire life and didn't think it would bleed into my career, I was wrong.

I am beating myself up for letting go something that will greatly change my life for the better, but I seriously could not get through the day to day to even take advantage of the health insurance. I will eventually get back into things. I truly do appreciate every single person that responded to the previous thread. There are good people in this industry (and those that are just enthusiasts).
A bit of a tactical ~~urbanism~~ moderation trial to help concentrate common questions around career and education advice.

**The current soft trial will:**

\- To the extent possible, refer users posting these threads to the scheduled posts.

\- Test the waters for aggregating this sort of discussion

\- Take feedback (in this thread) about whether this is useful

**If it goes well:**

\- We would add a formal rule to direct conversation about education or career advice to these threads

\- Ask users to help direct users to these threads

**Goal:**

To reduce the number of posts asking somewhat similar questions about Education or Career advice and to make the previous discussions more readily accessible.

Austrian here. Since i often cant really relate to some of the topics being brought up here: is this sub mainly focused on US/NA urban planning?  where do you guys work?
Location/region and type of role are helpful too. I'm currently in grad school doing a career change, and have gotten used to the very generous leave policies at the university jobs I've worked for the past several years. I currently get about 6 weeks of vacation and personal time per year (started at 5.5 and continues going up). 

While I highly doubt I'll find a planning job that starts that high, I'm hoping to get a sense of what the range is. I love to travel, and I have friends and family all over the place, so the thought of going back to only 2 weeks is killing me. A full-time coworker at my internship recently described their leave policy (which involves 0 vacation time for the first year, and 2 weeks for the next 5 years after that) as "very generous" and I died a little inside. What's been your experience with vacation time?
I was just think of ways that could help keep main residents in the heart of cities, and not hemorrhage out into the more economical outer city. I came up with banning tourism and/or airbnb, and building high-ceiling parking garages for camping trailers. Having combined facilities like a hotel; like, laundry room, bathrooms, showers, etc. My thinking is how blood flows out of the body without veins, and so having fresh blood flow in and out of the main arteries help keep the main blood new. If that makes sense. The parking garages would serve as artery walls that pump the old blood with new life and carry on traveling. I live in Texas and so I know we don't have any high speed rail for people to tour around in, but I was just wondering if we did have a metro or high speed rail would this be viable. Just wanted some thought on my idea. Pros and cons?

I was offered a job in a part of the country I’m not super fond of but it pays well for the area. The person who interviewed me and said they specifically pointed out how their previous city planner left after 5 years and how they want someone who’s in it for the long term. I don’t see myself living there for more than 3-4 years max. Is it unprofessional for me to accept a job if I already intend on not being there for the long term?
I'm curious what motivated the creation of FAR maximums. I understand the idea of zoning for uses and setbacks to mandate separation, but I'm curious why FAR maximums were also seen as a way to control urban form. Is there something an FAR maximum mitigates that setbacks do not?
Hello - I'm not an urban planner, demographer, etc. but recently was wondering about something, and thought I would ask the experts.  I was curious about the relationship between a town or city's percentage of a metro area as a whole, and their economic success.  Using a US example - if you're Renton, WA, you're in the Seattle metro area but you're a small fry compared to the 800 lb gorilla of Seattle.  Therefore the decisions that Seattle's govt makes are likely to effect Renton more than the other way around, meaning that this may harm the suburbs. 

Has this been studied?  If so, what's the answer?  Appreciate any insights.  I'm just curious! 


Two problems that kept me from answering it:

- I couldn't find GDP or per capita income at a city or town level, only for the metro area as a whole.

- Even if I could find the data in the first bullet, other things correlate with population (like density and property values) that could confound the answer.
I am not an urban planner, but I've become interested in the subject since buying a house, realizing my neighborhood and suburb suck, and discovering why. I have heard that most urban planners actually have a lot of good, helpful ideas about how to design cities but they are thwarted by local residents who either don't know what's good for them or represent a vocal minority of ne'er-do-wells. This got me thinking: what if there were a city in the US that actually embodied the best of what urban planning has to offer? My understanding is that to some extent there exist cities in Europe that are doing really well in this stuff, but even the best examples in the US still have a long way to go. NYC is still infested with cars, Philadelphia public transit is not funded anywhere near where it should be, etc.

Hypothetically, what if a critical mass of people passionate about good urban design all agreed to move to a town that was small enough they could dramatically shift or even completely control its politics? Alternatively, what if they collectively bought undeveloped land and turned it into an urbanist utopia? There exist privately managed master-planned communities that bear a resemblance to this, but they are more like companies than governments if I'm not mistaken. They also tend to be expensive, on too small a scale to really meet all your needs, and are often islands of walkability within the same car dependency that oppresses the rest of the country.

There is actually a precedent for something like this. The [Free State Project](https://www.fsp.org/) is a group of people who have agreed to move to NH to try to shift its politics in a more freedom-oriented direction. The results haven't necessarily been revolutionary, but they have been nothing to sneeze at. (Please note: I'd like to avoid a discussion of whether the policies they advocate for are morally good, I'm merely illustrating that such a movement of people with a common vision can in fact effect change in a US context). The status quo in urbanism is to "get active at the local level" but for now that just seems to be getting us disconnected bike lanes, inconsistent public transit, ever-expanding stroads, and the occasional, toothless, incremental upzoning law. Wouldn't it be more effective for the people who actually care about this stuff to concentrate? This way they can build out truly great examples with fewer roadblocks and serve as an example for outsiders to imitate. Imagine people from all over the country visiting an actual example of what urbanists want and going home to demand their city council deliver them the same. 

&#x200B;

1. What would such a community look like?
2. Is there any way something like this would actually happen?
3. Am I being overly optimistic about what such a community could achieve or otherwise totally off-base? In other words, are there existing cities in the US that already mostly embody everything an urbanist could hope for without taxing people to death?
Greetings, respected readers of r/urbanplanning.

I am a mathematician, and one of my hobbies is analyzing transportation problems. Recently, a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/14m67ur/adding_road_capacity_is_fruitless_another_study/) appeared here, stating that road expansion doesn't help to cope with traffic jams. I have a theoretical justification for why this is the case and how we should tackle the problem:

[A City without Traffic Jams](https://habr.com/en/articles/473528/)

To put it very briefly, the main function of a road network is usually considered to be the opportunity it provides to travel at high speeds over long distances. This is indeed the case when we talk about a network of highways laid out between cities. However, within cities, another function gains significant weight - solving the multiple addressing problem. The same task was previously solved by telephone exchanges, and is now solved by internet nodes: each car (each packet of information) must arrive at a strictly specified address. In communication theory, an inefficient solution to the multiple addressing problem will require huge resources from you, and in urban planning, it will lead to traffic jams.

The simplified result of my research can be presented as follows. In order for a road network to handle the multiple addressing function well, it should by no means create "high-volume" transport flows. Ideally, transportation should be distributed across a multitude of roughly equivalent roads, and cars travelling on a single road should be those whose routes largely coincide over a significant portion of their journey. According to my estimates, a grid-like road network is a very good solution for a city, whereas a radial network is one of the worst. Of course, it is impossible to rebuild all cities to fit a grid-like structure, but it is worth trying to reorganize their networks so that as many alternative routes as possible appear in them.

Reading this requires a good understanding of school-level mathematics and the basics of computer algorithm theory. I apologize for the sloppy layout: at the time of publication, the website where the article was posted did not support TeX insertion.

I hope that my ideas will help make your city's roads more free and fast. I am happy to answer your questions and would be grateful for feedback and criticism. Perhaps you would want to show my article to your colleagues who are currently making decisions about urban road network planning.



Hi, I’m a college student in the middle of an undergraduate degree in City and Regional Planning. I’m trying to get a planning internship with this large suburban city this summer. I have an interview with the director of their planning department scheduled tomorrow. Yes, I know, I’m sorry this is kind of last minute. I figure I have a couple hours to do any last preparations once I wake up. I’m very nervous because this is the first time I’ve ever had to do a formal interview for a job or internship.

So far, I have brainstormed and jotted down rough answers to about 6-7 questions that I expect will be asked based on what I looked up online, mainly the most important ones like “tell me about yourself”. I’m guessing I probably need more than that. I know for sure that at some point, I should mention my past experience interning at a local architecture firm for a couple summers (one of the group projects I did there connects well to urban planning) and my experience working on quarter-long urban design projects as a group in the two urban design studio courses I took last year, since those are probably the most important relevant experiences I can think of. There are also several other major classes that I have some experiences and lessons from that could be useful here (mainly related to land use, transportation, or environmental planning). I’ve also done pretty decent research on the city in terms of their recent developments in planning, including going over the general plan or housing element or watching a recent planning commission meeting. (I’m already highly familiar with this city since I live so close by.) I still feel pretty unprepared though. Like there are plenty of questions I can think of that I would be like a deer in the headlights if asked. For example, I can’t think of a specific experience where I ran into conflict with someone and then successfully resolved it, or if I hypothetically run into some sort of interpersonal conflict (e.g. with zoning or design), I most likely wouldn’t know how to answer “what would you do?”.

What kind of preparation do you think I should focus on with the remaining time I have? Also, would bringing a copy of my portfolio from my urban design studios be useful at all? What is the etiquette around bringing speaking notes to an interview? Any kind of advice would be appreciated.
I’m not an urban planner, but I’m interested in the field. I hear a lot about moving away from car dependency and it makes sense to me. 

One question I’ve had lately is how would walkable cities be designed with extreme heat in mind? A benefit to cars is that they’re typically air conditioned, and I’m not sure a city could compensate for that.
I see a lot a parcels in my area that have been undeveloped for 20+ years, which are large parcels 20-40 acres for the given area. These parcels have a timber/forestry designation on them for tax purposes, even though they are in the middle of a R1 style zoning designation.

This is in a well established area, not like we are talking about rural forested areas or forest lands. and in my 40 years of living in the area have never seen them forested or harvested.

I know trees take a LONG time to grow, but is there some sort of ruling that the land has to be used or show recipes for use of forest or timber within 'XX' amount of years to qualify for this? I mean we are talking about someone being taxed $80 a year vs tens of thousands of dollars per year.

I understand why an individual would want to do this, and would do the same thing, but at the same time this particular area is trying to promote growth. One kick start in my opinion would be to show proof that those areas are being used for timber, if not, remove the designation and tax it how it is zoned. You do this, and that land will get developed very quickly.

I know every state is different, but does anyone have insight on the thresholds or qualifications to be designate land as timber/forest harvest?
I know they can vote and maybe go to town meetings. But sadly, I feel like most people only go to the meeting if something controversial comes up. How could citizens suggest things like “we would like a town green, or a dog park, or more Mom and Pop restaurants instead of all franchises”?


Looking for ways in which Hayden Field missed some definitions and want some opinions to weigh in.
So a few years ago I remember reading about a petition that would force the Berlin government to make the city car free. The movement was sometimes called the autofrei movement. [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/06/berlins-car-ban-campaign-its-about-how-we-want-to-live-breathe-and-play) even reported on it. But since then I've heard very little on it. I did manage to find a [website](https://volksentscheid-berlin-autofrei.de/index.php?lang=en) for the movement. I was wondering if anyone knew about the progress of the movement/what happened to it?
Hi! I’m in my very first internship in a mid-sized city’s planning department. I want to learn as much as I can, but sometimes I’m not sure what to ask or where to start. What do you wish you had asked when you were an intern?
I am going to Chicago pretty soon, and I am looking for some tips and critiques to help me determine how well planned Chicago is.
How bad do you think it is if I only use examples from one of my professional planning jobs for the written response questions on the AICP experience assessment? 

I'm filling out the AICP experience assessment to and in a few places the form refers to filling out the questions "using the entirety of your verified professional planning experience." I worked for a municipality where I was much more involved in the whole process for about 75% of my experience and currently work for a private planning firm where the work is more technical study oriented (so I'm much more removed from scoping, decision-making, implementation). Anyways, the municipal job just applies much more clearly and I could make the private job work for a question or two, but it would come across very one dimensional. 



The United States EPA is surprisingly based in terms of knowing downsides of car dependency and the upsides of good urban design. But it's just sad how they aren't implementing changes fast enough
Which city/cities in either of these metros would you work for and why?


Hello Planners

So I'm going to start my undergraduate in the fall and I've been pretty happy about it since it's a field that I'm passionate in. However, I've heard from some people that the career prospects are not ideal and that it pays lower compared to other related fields. Is this indeed case in North America? How competitive is the market?
Graduated with an accredited masters many, many moons ago but right in the middle of the financial crash and never managed to get a job. Fell into another career path and here I am, pretty unfulfilled and unmotivated because it’s a bad fit for me.

Would really like to get into planning, but clearly it’s been a long time, so realise I need to ‘refresh’ substantially.

I’d love to take some kind of online refresher / short course if possible. Do these exist? I think doing another masters is a bit overkill (mostly on my wallet).

If anyone can recommend something then that would be appreciated :)
[Duluth Waterfront Collective ](https://www.highway61duluth.com/reconnecting-communities-letter) 

We are desperately trying to better our connection from Duluth's hillside neighborhood to canal park in Duluth MN. The freeway cuts right in the middle of the downtown corridor and are trying to turn it into a parkway. The website explains more in further detail. Thank you so so much!
 I live in a city with a strong mayor system and I've been a critic of this form of government for a while now (or, a critic of my mayor at least). 

It seems like city councils under strong mayor regimes basically act as a rubber stamp for whatever the mayor wants to do and give very little push back.

I'm sure strong council type governments have their drawbacks too, but I cant help but to think that my mayor would be a little bit more useful if he was held accountable to a larger council instead of being "held accountable" once every four years.

Very curious to know what you guys think.
In the 1930s-50s, cities across North America adopted model zoning codes for car-oriented design. In the 1990s, the Congress for New Urbanism tried to reverse the trend by creating the SmartCode, a model zoning code for walkability. But all the cities I know of who have implemented walkable zoning have created their own bespoke zoning — at major cost in time and resources. 

Is there something wrong with the SmartCode? Maybe the transect idea is better in theory than practice? Answers especially appreciated from anyone familiar with the code or have tried to use it. 
I'm interested in the intersection of psychology and the built environment (urban planning architecture, landscape). Are there any newsletters/blogs you can recommend?
I have ADD, and I've found that giving myself challenges keeps my background brain occupied while I work, and I'm less distracted day to day. For the past year, that mental chewing gum has been urban design. Ukraine's [lost a lot of cities](https://youtu.be/BBCPBqzOQdY), and I wanted to contribute my 2 cents to their rebuilding effort- an urban design that's affordable, scalable, and economically sustainable over time.

**I am not a planner.** I DO have construction experience. I've lived in remote countryside + cookie cutter suburbs + dense walkable urban communities (US/Europe). I was also a delivery man for Amazon- you see a community differently when it's your job to drive up and down EVERY street, alley, and dirt road. I've circled busy city blocks desperate for a parking spot, and driven THROUGH streams to tiny farm houses. It REALLY taught me about planning in practice. Ultimately though, **this is just a fun thought experiment I had**.

I started out by imagining a town and then trying to remove things so I could boil it down to its fundamentals (a lot like that [Iron Man scene](https://youtu.be/Ddk9ci6geSs?t=52) less a few holograms). Making streets one way would open up more sidewalk space for pedestrians and local restaurants. Minimizing stoplights+street signs would save a ton of money. Heck, what if I could make blocks larger, then fill the awkward interiors with warehouse space, hidden behind regular Main Street cafes and apartments? Many jobs these days are in warehouses / small factories, so finding a system that incorporates *some* of these ugly buildings into an urban fabric might make a huge difference in job accessibility and combatting sprawl.

Anyways.

[Grid doodle](https://i.imgur.com/pCKhtun.jpg) \-- [Intersection doodle](https://i.imgur.com/PrtObVV.jpg)

My new grid is a typical grid but with exclusively one way streets. Then I dragged out the intersections diagonally so they became diagonal merge lanes. I'm simplifying, it took months to get here. But this new grid needs no stop lights, no signage, can be pedestrian-oriented, has virtually no traffic buildup, is significantly cheaper for cities to maintain in the long run, and so on.

* Stoplights / stop signs are expensive
* One way streets have shorter, safer crosswalks
* Narrower streets = more sidewalk space
   * Cafes, greenery, and everything pedestrian
* Intersections are now two 45deg turns, not one 90deg turn, promoting visibility+flow
* The turns at every intersection are also great traffic calming measures
   * No need for speed limit signage
   * Vehicle sound pollution over 20mph/30kmh is more from tires than engines
* Angled intersections minimize sound pollution
   * The staggered intersections prevent sound from traveling in a straight line very far

The list goes on, but that's the gist. Initial impressions?
Could deinstitutionalization (closing down all mental hospitals across the nation) have been a contributing factor (intended or unintended) towards suburbanization and car dependency in the USA? Do you see a connection? Thoughts?


[According to this OSU page listing urban planning licencing boards](https://odee.osu.edu/state-professional-planner-licensure-boards), most US states do not require licencing or certification to work as an urban planner. Does this mean any Joe can become one regardless of their qualifications? 
Hello All,  
I am currently finishing up my bachelor's in urban planning and sustainability this month. Unfortunately, going into the job hunt, I didn't have any technical experience working in planning, as it was tricky for me to take up an internship position while working full-time. But I have been hitting brick wall after brick wall with applications. I stick with openings with 0-1 year of experience, but I usually do not get an interview.  
I highlight my experience in customer service, project management, and communication skills. What should I do to help improve my chances of at least getting an interview? I appreciate the tips, as It's starting to become demoralizing.

What unions do planners join if any at all? I’m in school getting my undergrad in urban and regional studies and am very open to joining a union when my time comes to enter the professional planning world. Thanks in advance!
I've always wondered why there is a seemingly random rural subdivision in the middle of the Colorado Springs suburban sprawl. It's a part of the city proper, not a satellite city or anything. It's around 38.862563, -104.736995, and looks like this https://imgur.com/a/rBwfZ4L.
I’m a new planner and I’m learning fast but wow, the learning curve is steep!  I’m looking forward to the day when I’m actually good at my job.


It's a common argument peddled by suburbanists like the infamous Randal O'Toole, and it does seem to make intuitive sense as it doesn't require any real infrastructure buildout, but there isn't any hard data on this.

is anybody in this sub a masters dropout? like you attempted finishing a masters degree and couldn’t or didn’t want to complete it? How’s it going? 

i just finished my first year and was on probation after the first semester but couldn’t get off it and now my financial aid is cut off …

i think im really burnt out with academics, I’ve had family problems that made it worse and im trying to get therapeutic help to deal with everything and be a decent student 

but a big part of me wants to say fuck it!! i am so tired of looking for validation but the biggest reason im doing this for is to land a job and i feel so pathetic rn im turning 25 soon and working only a PT cause I decided to come to grad school and knew I couldn’t handle a full time at the same time but even prior to that i was working at a grocery store a year from having finished my BA .. i blame being a june 2020 graduate but idk my peers seem to be doing well now 

anyways im just worried if i leave and don’t finish then I’ll be back at square one and will have to settle for very low pay and a job i don’t wanna do 

i currently work for an org that i wouldn’t mind staying with though and im sure they wouldn’t leave me if I don’t finish but it would be awkward telling them I dropped out — also eventually want to work in urban design maybe in the california bay or east coast (Philly, NYC)

has anybody else dealt with something similar and how do you see yourself now? how did you deal with it?
I've been frustrated for quite a while with urban sprawl and the issues caused by it.  After a lot of thought and study, it seems that the root cause of sprawl is the overwhelming adoption of single-family zoning, and maybe the approach to zoning in general.

Sprawl emerges because people have to constantly drive from residential zone to commercial zone to a business zone to recreational zone.  It's madness.

I understand the draw of wanting your own space with a front and back yard and no shared walls, separate from the city, but at present, many cities have so much single family zoning that home buyers have little choice, and nothing to do in their neighborhoods except drive.  I believe the current housing crisis in many regions is directly caused by a lack of understanding what people want and structures that are preventing it from being built.

Specifically, I'd like to see more and better options in the missing middle, with more walkable, multi-use areas.  But the trend seems to be to continue building out sprawl in suburbs, with high rise condos in downtowns with transit centers and tiny pockets of walkability, surrounded dangerously heavy traffic.  The majority of housing being built either has a big front and back yard that are barely used out in the suburbs, or it's a high-rise condo with minimal space and a tiny balcony.

I have an idea that may not be original, but may be able to change the trajectory of city development with a single zoning regulation change for each region.  As a working title, let's call it "flexible adjacency".

The idea of flexible adjacency is that instead of strict zoning boundaries, properties should be allowed to be developed similarly to nearby properties.  Nearby could mean within 3-5 parcels separation or a specific distance, like 300'-500'.

The reasoning for this approach is that owners of properties in the vicinity of one another should have the right to develop to the same level of density and land use as their neighbors.  Anything less is unfair to property owners who want to improve their property.

Where I live we have sprawling single-family homes directly adjacent to urban streets that have high rise apartments and dense commercial malls.  Nothing else (other than carriage houses) can be built on the single-family lots without going through a long and painful rezoning process that has no certainty of passing.  Similarly, in spite of overwhelming demand for housing, commercial properties cannot have residences in them without similar rezoning.

A few examples of how the flexible adjacency approach would work:

* If there is commercial on one side of a property and residential across the street, mixed use should be automatically allowed.  Both land uses are clearly in the character of the neighborhood and able to be handled by streets, utilities and emergency services.  Demand and owners' needs should determine how the properties are developed, not an arbitrary boundary defined by a council that has no stake in the development, and not neighbors who nearly always want to prevent new development next to their homes.
* A row of single-family single-story homes next to a 12 story high rise should automatically be allowed to at least split the difference, going from 1 story to six or more, depending on what else is around.  The idea here is that not only should the single-story owner be able to build higher, but the adjacent high rises should be kept to a reasonable height.  This would tend toward higher land use, since it's more efficient and cost effective to develop toward higher density.
* A residential high rise next to commercial shopping should by default be allowed to convert lower floors to commercial, and a commercial building with adjacent residential should be able to convert commercial space to residential.

All of these examples seem like they should be common sense.  I think this approach could rapidly shift from demand for sprawl to rapid redevelopment growth, increasing the number and quality of walkable communities.   I believe this simple idea could organically lead to less vehicle traffic and healthier communities.

Speaking of which, I'd like to know what this community thinks of the idea.

I haven't heard of this approach.  Is it already in use?  Is there an existing name for it, or can the group suggest better names?

I suspect it's already the default in some places.  Is it already in use or has it been tried?

What are pitfalls, complaints and concerns?
Hello everyone, I am finding it hard to find jobs with my degree as I only have a bachelors in planning and do not have the means to go to grad school. I am wondering if anyone used their degree to pivot to another field or know of any people who have. Thanks and sorry if this is a question or something you guys get alot.
Hi everyone, I have a question on accessing datasets on urban planning and the environment. For one of my CS classes, I completed a project to visually show how introducing improvements to bike and bus infrastructure can improve air quality to my home city of Philadelphia. Since then, I've been looking into expanding the project to promote accessible cities and their benefits. One of the problems I've faced was gathering data for the topic. Does anyone know any resources?
How does that work exactly?  If a planning board recommends something or grants permission, can the town come along and invalidate the planning board's decision?

Me personally as a Detroiter, I think that the city/region would be profoundly different if we copied LA's transit system and it's varied use of metros, light rail, BRT, and commuter rail.

 Like LA, Metro Detroit is very car-oriented and decentralized and has urban centers/job clusters all over the place. Having a decentralized (primarily rail based) transit system would be very helpful in spurring development in the city and outer suburbs like Southfield, Warren, and Downriver on top of connecting already-existing spaces.

What about you guys? where would you borrow from?

Apologies if this is in the wrong subreddit. 

I posted here a bit ago about the 14 acre  historical park in my area that is covered with graffiti, litter, is housing homeless and has dead birds near the large pond. 

Someone mentioned gentrification in a comment and I did some research on the topic because I wasn’t familiar with it; now I have some questions. 

This area was not always run down; it used to be one of the prettiest parks in the southern US. I don’t pretend to know what happened in the past 80-100 years but clearly it’s not anymore although I could see the potential for it to a beautiful attraction before I googled the parks history. 

I realized that if we hypothetically renovated the park next week into something amazing it wouldn’t change anything long term. There would still be homeless people sleeping there (I want them to have safe solutions too but you can’t enjoy a park with people sleeping in it. I don’t pretend to know what to do about that), you would still have litter and trash in the pond as well as new graffiti on play spaces. 

So, is that why housing and businesses are built and renovated first to bring interest from tenants and consumers belonging to higher income brackets or is it just because it’s a cheap income producing area to flip/rent? 

What does that actually mean for the residents that live in the area now? Where do they go? What do they do? Do they join the homeless community? Should the developers and housing committees be responsible for building new affordable housing if they take the current housing? Then again, it’s not safe or healthy to keep structures that are in disrepair as is and they should be renovated so it’s not like it’s a bad thing. 

Basically, what happens in real life when we take housing from those of lower income and replace it? What is the reality of this scenario in your experience?

Thank you

Editing to thank everyone for the feedback, I appreciate the information and education on this topic.
There is a local park in my downtown area that is clearly out of date. It had graffiti on the playground, litter everywhere, dead birds around the water and the grounds are just plain uninviting and there are homeless people asleep mid day on the benches. 

It is in an “up and coming” area so you have the upscale residential area with the expensive housing and boutique properties then you walk about 4 blocks to the indie, “quirky but safe” underground local businesses and one block over is this huge park. So, i guess it just hasn’t been gotten to yet but I’ve been thinking about what I could do to help fix it up to be inviting for kids as I don’t see other places around for them to go to outside.

My question is who handles that? Is it the city? If so, is that a 9-5 job you apply for or do they hire outside people who are interested in the project and contact them about it? Is this something a public officer does, like a city councilman? 

Thanks for educating me!

Editing to add that I wish I could figure out a solution for the homeless as they need safe resources as well, I don’t want to just kick them out and say they aren’t welcome but it’s also hard to enjoy public spaces with people asleep in them. That’s way beyond my “pay grade” though and hopefully someone more knowledgeable than myself can find some answers.
did US planners ever experiment with non rectangular geometry?

I just watched another one of NJBs videos, this one about the so-called tired excuse of size and distance playing a factor into why we don't have the same public transit here in North America as they do in The Netherlands.

&#x200B;

One thing that I saw mentioned that sparked this entire exercise was his mention of the Quebec-Windsor corridor here in Canada as an example of where 50% of Canadians live.Though this is true, we still are not even remotely a fair analogue to be compared to the Netherlands, because density is the X factor in viable transit.

&#x200B;

So to make a fair comparison I did the following exercise: I took the lists of cities with over 100K population and over 1000 persons per KM\^2 in The Netherlands and my home province (and formerly NJBs) of Ontario.This is already giving a huge benefit of the doubt to NJBs side since I'm looking the entire country of the Netherlands and only the most populated region of the most populated province in Canada, but you'll find the numbers STILL heavily favour the argument that these are not even remotely in the same ballpark.

&#x200B;

Graphing each of the 100K cities as nodes on a weighted graph, with the minimum distance between any 2 nodes added we see that the entire nation of the Netherlands has an average distance between nodes of 37.5 km and a worst case of 100 km.

&#x200B;

Over here in the DENSEST region of Canada, we have a worst case of over 206 km! And an average of nearly 90 km.Over here in the DENSEST region of Canada, we have a worst case of over 206 km! And an average of nearly 90 km.

As climate change continues to affect the Sunbelt and the deserts of the West, more and more people will be looking to find fairer climates and places with little to no natural disasters. While we know that this process ***will*** happen the question that hangs in the air is ***how many*** people will be willing to migrate because of climate change.

Here in Southeast Michigan our [Council of Government](https://maps.semcog.org/forecast/) is assuming that the region will only grow by 315k by the time 2050 rolls around (which, in my opinion is a terrible forecast that excludes climate factors). This is even after article after article posits that the state of Michigan will become a "climate haven" as the years go on.

Are there similar population projections around the Midwest/Rust Belt like SEMCOG's? What level of migration should be planned for? Do you think those projections on the right track?

If the projections are actually off, what sort of investments should be employed in the region to ensure that there are no unintended consequences like a housing crisis or employment crisis?





I'm from the US, where most urban transit systems use a flat-rate fare system in which a trip between any two points on the network costs the same price. This means that longer trips are effectively subsidized by shorter trips. I understand that this is one aspect in which even well-developed US transit systems differ from major systems elsewhere, which tend to use the zone-based fare systems that you mainly see on commuter rail in North America. In the US, some advocates talk about fare-free transit as a way to get more people using underutilized systems, but it isn't something that I've seen being seriously considered on major systems (sorry Estonia) that don't currently have a ton of excess capacity, and I'm frankly very skeptical that the equity gained is greater than if you spent the same money on other social services.

There's plenty of info on how payment systems impact user experience (travel cards are easier and reduce dwell times, etc.), but I'm struggling to find information on how various fare structures are evaluated from a fiscal and operational standpoint, assuming that the payment experience is largely the same. For example, if London switched to a flat-rate fare system tomorrow, how would it change the system? Do fares impact people's travel behavior if tap cards make the user experience of payment the same system-wide? How are travel zone boundaries determined?

If anybody can point me in the right direction, I'd appreciate it!
I am an Air Traffic Controller in my 30s. Although I have no formal education, I have a strong commitment to continuous learning and personal development.

For over 15 years, I have had a deep desire to be in the planning field. While my life has taken a different path thus far, I am now exploring the possibility of changing careers… better late than never. Working as an ATC though limits my availability to attend formal education.

What are my options? Anyway to enter the field without a degree and self study alone?
I have found that I love urban planning. I don't have a degree, but I'm willing to go back to school eventually. That being said, I'm looking for a career change and was wondering if there are good entry-level positions with opportunities to grow in the field without having a degree or any certifications yet. 

Any advice would be appreciated!
I'm considering taking it this fall, but there are initial expenses and annoying ongoing costs associated with keeping it current. Employers are requiring less and less in my area (Chicago). However, I've been in planning for 10 years and could probably pass the test without much studying... or is that naive of me to think? Is taking the AICP worth it for future career growth in the planning field?
After getting my MPL a few years ago, I accepted a job in another field where my degree comes up occasionally but not often enough to keep me up to date on what's happening in the field. I miss it!

What blogs, newsletters, books, social media accounts, websites, etc do you follow to keep up with what's happening in the planning world?
A few months ago I went to Querétaro, and they have the [world’s cutest traffic signals](https://mexicodailypost.com/2021/08/25/otami-lele-traffic-lights-arrive-in-the-city-of-queretaro-video/).  

There is an indigenous doll, Lele, that is sort of a mascot for the city. And the pedestrian sign for the traffic signals have her dancing on the green light, in the city center area. 

I had never seen custom pedestrian signals. It was amazing.



I still like urban planning, but I think what I discovered in grad school is I actually just love geography and GIS. I'm one week into a planning job at a great private firm, but I feel like I have been thrown to the wolves with little training and the pressure to work fast/billable hours is killing me. I'm not eating, I'm throwing up every morning, and crying every evening. 

I had a panic attack at the office yesterday and had to just bail. No one saw, I just IM'd my boss that I was having a personal emergency.

Am I wrong/soft for wanting to quit? What I really want to do I WFH and make maps. I'm about to be 30 and this is my first planning gig (outside of a public sector internship) after grad school/career change.

If anyone else has experienced this or has any insight, it would be so appreciated.
While the last several years have seen a lot of discussions about census trends and overall zip code movement during and following the pandemic, I have yet to read anything that mentions accurate counting of cities’ WFH populations. Obviously, this is a very difficult task but would result in extremely value information for government officials. 

I’m super curious if anyone has heard of success in counting or polling residents to get a figure of remote workers in any given area (township, county, city)?

Any thoughts or case studies on how a count like this could be conducted? 
Are there any cities that are particularly forward thinking in getting the most out of remote workers within their communities?
I see a lot of posts on here about different jobs- be it seeking advice or simply inquiring about opportunities and education background. Thought I’d share my winding path to the planning world for those like me who did not have any formal background in the field. I have a BS in Earth Science with a concentration in Hydrogeology. Upon graduation I did several different jobs ranging from conservation in non-profit world to stream restoration to environmental consulting, etc. On a whim I decided to apply for a Stormwater planning position in the county I live in (mostly out of desperation to leave a job that was an awful fit) low and behold I was hired! I knew absolutely nothing about planning but had the technical background in hydrology. Never heard of an “ordinance” or “CO” and never paid any attention to rules of development. As an outsider coming in to the profession I find these policy level aspects fascinating and love to blend my science background with regulation. There is a career out there you! Apply for that job in desperation, it just might be the perfect fit. Lol.

Hi guys I am a soon to graduate civil engineer, who is also doing a minor in urban planning and design. I am going into traffic engineering, which means a PE would be the first thing I should go for. Yet, there is also a lot of firms that combine transportation planning with traffic engineering which then lead me to think that an AICP would also be useful. Do you guys think that if I study on my own I could pass the AICP? Or without a masters in urban planning it would be impossible ?

Thanks

... when a planning analysis makes recommendations that don't reflect needs and conditions in the actual planning area?

As an example, where I live, a state agency recommended closing vehicle and pedestrian access at a specific railroad crossing citing "safety concerns"; however, in the 10-year observation period, there were ZERO safety incidents.  I'm familiar with the sayings like "garbage in garbage out" and "ivory tower planning", but is there a specific term to describe this?  tyia

Edit:  the belief is that the state/transit agency is attempting to save money by not modernizing the crossing.
It is very nice to see that there are now many urbanist YouTube videos and channels in places like North America to bring more attention to the benefits of a better urban environment. However, there is not a lot of urbanist content in the UK. Is there not much of a New Urbanism movement in the UK?
I'm asking this because my state (Michigan) has been bleeding college educated young people for four decades now and there doesn't seem to be a way to stop the migration. I'm seeing mutual friends in my age range saying that they would consider relocating for better job opportunities as well. 

Can good urban planning help retain young people? Is job diversity spurred by more mixed uses? I'm eager to know the answer for this.
Hi there, there is a problem in my Californian city where developers who have had their projects/tract maps approved for nearly 20 years are not building their projects. There are two main reasons for this: the state of California automatically granted extensions of time for the developers to build their projects during the '08 recession and more recently during COVID, and my city has an ordinance (which follows state law) where developers can request two three-year extensions as well. 

The problem is sort of a catch-22, as one member of our city's planning commission put it. If the planning commission does not grant an extension of time, the land will sit vacant for even longer, and nothing will get built. But at the same time, the city is tired of developers basically sitting on the land and doing nothing with it other than letting it accumulate value beacuse the state had granted them extensions. 

Additionally, I'm not really sure what will happen to the projects if the planning commission does not approve their extensions of time for their vesting tract maps. Will the developers be forced to sell it, and the process starts all over? If that is the case, then it's my opinion that in some ways this might be beneficial in my opinion because the developers would have to comply with current city standards rather than ones from nearly 20 years ago (ie; better amenities for pedestrians, cyclists, etc.) Most of these projects are also exclusively single-family homes, so I don't think it would be a bad thing for them to get denied until the city finishes reforming its zoning code to provide for a more diverse housing choice.

Anyways, I'm trying to think of ways that the city can use its power to either crack down on these developers or give some sort of incentive/punishment so that these projects get built. My city's planning commission would be totally on board with anything ideas because they are sick and tired of hearing five or six extensions of time requests each meeting when we are in an affordable housing crisis. Would love to hear your guys' thoughts. Let me know if there is anything else I can clarify because I'm sure I missed some details.
I'm doing some person research on  ways to reduce traffic in cities, and I'm having trouble finding a general consensus on ring roads. I'm looking into whether or not removing highways in NYC, without additional construction, to create a sort of beltway around the city, which has been an interesting thought experiment. If anyone has knowledge on this subject or questions, please comment down below, I would really appreciate it!

I recently had a discussion with a friend and he claimed that “Florida will never be walkable” because I’d the extreme heat and heavy rain in the summer. While he has a point about the brutality of the heat (and humidity) I still feel like that argument is short-sighted. Are there any examples of walkable infrastructure in hot climates and what do cities do to make the experience less unpleasant?
I have heard that pretty much most cities Europe, Canada and some US Major Cities (in Blue States) have stopped building major highways within the inner city since their arguement is that it would create many induce demand but Australian Cities have done the opposite by buidlding new road tunnel in the inner city. I wonder why is this the case?

Any planners here go the City Management route or are in an Assistant/Director role? 

I am currently a City Planner for a major city in Texas, hopefully about to get this Policy job with a major County in Texas. Eventually I want to get into City Management. Any advice?
I've always wondered about this. Say you're an urban planner and you live in the same city you work for. There is an item on the agenda at a public meeting (e.g. city council, planning commission, etc.) that you have strong opinions on, and you were not directly involved with the matter in your official capacity as a city planner. Is it okay for you to either submit written comments or speak during the public hearing as a private citizen (off the clock), or would that be considered a conflict of interest since you work for the city? Does the answer to this question differ depending on whether the item in question is planning-related or not?

Hi there! I'm looking into becoming an Urban Planner, by studying it as my major in University. I'm gonna keep this short and very simple. How stable is this career when compared to the jobs related to Computer Science for example.

My parents doubt it'll benefit me compared to jobs like Software Engineering and that i won't be able to find any jobs within Planning, thus making those 5 years spent on a Masters in Planning a waste of time. I really want to create more liveable urban spaces for everybody to enjoy and be in. I live in Europe if that's of any importance.

Thanks in advance!
I know malls are multi-story but why are so many of the smaller strip malls and power centers all one floor? You can take a big box corner store like Home Depot and build a second story on top of it with smaller retail like cell phone, lighting and whatever else for a smaller footprint.
Curious to hear about your experiences with using AI to assist you in your work. Personally, I use chat GPT frequently. I know there are a plethora of other AI programs out there, so I want to know if you find any others useful!
Are they limited by the funding allocation from HUD, or can they provide additional state funding to increase the number of vouchers given out?
Don't get me wrong, I am absolutely in favour of banning exclusionary zoning and increasing density, walkability, etc. I just find it strange that we focus so much on the effect of supply and demand on housing costs when, regarding prices in any other sector of the economy, we know to be skeptical of purely market-based solutions. 

I don't disagree entirely that increasing supply will decrease prices, and there's research to back that up, but much of the research I have read seems to indicate that it will not help significantly. Historically, public investment in and subsidization of housing has been equally as important in keeping costs low. Should we not be focusing more on left wing economic solutions such as public housing, social welfare, etc.?

What do you folks think are other policies crucial in addressing the housing crisis that left-urbanists don't talk about enough and that don't simply rely on the invisible hand of the free market?

Lastly, if you are not a left-urbanist or if you have more faith in the free market than I do, feel free to disagree, but this post isn't addressed to you.
I work for a major city and looking for new opportunities that will set me up for policy planning. Thinking about going County as I have a second interview. 
Anyone flip to County? 
Experiences? 
Advice?

I have been interested in learning more about development and getting into it. Been reading a lot about urban planning, zoning etc. 

Recently, my city underwent a significant change in its zoning regulations, adopting a Form-Based Zoning specifically for multi-residential housing (up to five units). Previously, the building form and various parameters like buildable area(sqr footage) were constrained by zoning requirements, including the FSI. However, the new zoning changes has eliminated the FSI requirement and shifted towards a form-based approach. Now, the buildable form is primarily governed by other factors such as height, depth, setbacks, and lot coverage.

As someone keenly interested in development, I found myself contemplating the best way to approach these changes and identify potential opportunities. While architects and planners are undoubtedly best suited for determining the optimal building form, I wanted to explore a more simplified perspective i.e a back-of-the-napkin approach to calculate the buildable area and other things.

Previously, calculating the buildable square footage was relatively straightforward, revolving around the FSI and other limitations. However, with the removal of the FSI requirement, I've shifted my focus towards evaluating lot coverage as a starting point. By considering lot coverage and progressively working upwards, I've been able to form a rough estimate of the total square footage that can be built within the given parameters.

What other factors should I consider when optimizing this back-of-the-napkin model for scoping out opportunities in this new form-based zoning paradigm?

Thanks in advance.
Hello Im 16 and unsure what I want to do in the future and I also need a job. Urban Planning has become a interest of mine which I initially learnt about through people like NJB (Not Just Bikes) but Im unsure if I would enjoy doing it for work. So I figured if I was able to work around urban planners in some sort of basic as role that needs no requirements that might allow me to get some insight into what a planner does on a daily basis.

TLDR: Is there any role that has basically no requirements and works with planners?

Also sorry if this isnt the right place for this question :(

I live in an outer suburb which has low frequency busses that often don't take direct routes as they go through the suburban streets to go through as large an area as possible.

What if we had a bus system which allowed you to pre-book trips so that it could match you with other people also making the same trip? This way, bus trips could be more flexible in their destinations and may be able to travel longer distances if people have booked along that route. Connections are possible if vehicles arrive at nodes at the same time.

You could have an app that has a map of different nodes you can travel to and have different prices for each one. The app can also notify you if the bus you've booked is approaching your node to be ready for pickup. Nodes are cheaper along arterials.

Since most people own cars in the outer suburbs, the use-cases for these busses would be to beat traffic during peak times for commuting or other regular trips.

There would still need to be a regular bus service (even if it's to fill in the blanks on roads that haven't been booked by anyone) so that all potential bus routes have service.

Thoughts?
Our census in Australia has commute distance and method of travel and other stats but they don't show us where people work based on where they live. Are there other ways to find this out?

I'm trying to fix a stroad that gets clogged up at peak hour and need specific data so that I can see if public transit would help.
So essentially, I'm really interested in the idea of shifting some of our urban living into underground.
I've researched a lot about it and I came across a proposed project for Tokyo from the 80s called Alice City.

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_City?wprov=sfla1

I understand this mindset may not work everywhere, but in location's where flooding isn't an issue I can't see too many drawbacks. It would reduce light pollution, create more livable space, be more energy efficient for climate control, and hopefully increase usage of underground mass transit. What do you all think?
It seems that the prevailing thought on here is that all cities should be bulldozed and replaced with Burj Khalifas (or at least high rises) to "maximize density".

And Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Bronx neighborhoods where 5 to 6 story prewar buildings (and 4 story brownstones) are common have population densities up to 120k ppsm!

If you genuinely think 100k ppsm is not dense enough, can you point to a neighborhood with higher population density that is better from an urban planning standpoint? And why should the focus on here be increasing the density of already extremely dense neighborhoods, rather than creating more midrise neighborhoods?
Hi. I'm in a city that has great inner-city transit options with trams but which sprawls to the point of no sidewalks along major arteries once you get to around 25km out. You can see the progression from shops everywhere along a main street at the start of this road to mostly housing developments with big box stores and malls later on.

The housing developments are beautiful and have much space for nature, but they attract a lot of traffic on the arterial road that leads to them.

What are we to do to reduce traffic in peak hour? I see that train use is at 7% for this local area for commuting and it takes about an hour to get to the CBD once you're on the train. It's mostly park and ride.

If you want more context, it's the Mernda line in Melbourne, Australia.

As an urban planner, what role (if any) would one play in bringing in new business to an area? I am not a planner but I am involved with local nonprofits and my 3 major goals to help bring into my smaller city are sustainable energy, business development and economic growth, and beautification of the downtown and surrounding wards. 

I want to get more into urban planning but I also want to entice more business here. Not just restaurants or retail (which we have plenty) but legit economic drivers such as pharmaceutical, industrial/manufacturing, tech and startups.
Current civil engineer sitting on a job offer for transit planner role. I want to pivot out of design and into planning (specifically excited by opportunity to interact with public and state agencies, use GIS & learn about grants). 

Reading a lot of horror stories about transit planning. 

Can any one share their (positive or negative) experience as a transit planner?

Edit: planning role is within state agency (public)
I am a civil engineer that is finishing their first year of work with a small US consulting engineering firm. 

I have gone done the rabbit hole of career hopping to urban planning and now know it’s not all Cities Skylines in that field but the concepts of the industry are still interesting. 

So two part question:
With the amount of emphasis on politics in the field, what can I do as a citizen to help the progress of city sustainability. 

Second, as a civil engineer, what types of jobs could I be looking for that help to scratch the itch of contributing to a city’s planning and infrastructure.
I recently received a bachelors degree in urban planning from ASU but am currently living in another state in a relatively small city. This would be my very first planning related job. 

The job is for the County, please give me any and all interview prep that can help me get this job as somebody freshly graduated with no professional or internship experience. 

I already talked to the person who will be interviewing me on the phone in a phone interview/informational call. The job will mostly involve reading architectural site plans and knowing the zoning codes and regulations for single developments so that I can communicate with the public (citizens or developers/contractors) to explain why their requests have been approved or denied. I’d also be responsible for a small bit of public speaking in front of small groups at a podium and creating/presenting PowerPoints. They use GIS, but in my position I’d likely not be responsible for creating maps, just utilizing overlays and being able to interpret them. I do have basic GIS knowledge (ArcGIS Desktop which is what they use).

The recruiter said the qualities they are looking for is somebody that has customer service skills and background, ability to learn the codes and regulations and research in order to communicate them to other people, conflict resolution, and he did ask if I had experience reading site plans in which I do not but it is not a requirement as long as I can learn.

Please, please, please, I would appreciate as many tips as you’re willing to give. I tend to get nervous in interviews and my ability to effectively communicate what makes me a good candidate can be hindered by that. I have tons of customer service experience, supervisory experience, and in my last job in the conservation field, we did interact with many different partners and stakeholders to complete projects and did GIS monitoring. So I will highlight my experience there.

Another thing is that he said he will be asking me more about my education at the interview, so how can I make myself look better by talking about that?
E-bikes initially seemed exciting because they had potential to reduce car dependency in the sprawled out US.

However, there's been a lot of pushback, especially from older people. There have been calls to ban e-bikes because kids have been riding them recklessly. My city compromised and slapped a lot of new regulations on them. My public comment wasn't enough against the wave of complaints.

The fundamental issue is that the bike infrastructure isn't safe, which drives cyclists onto the sidewalk, but it feels like instead of improving infrastructure, cities will make it as hard as possible to use e-bikes if not outright ban them. Is there any hope this paradigm will change as older people pass away or would the current younger generations also adopt the same positions as they grow older?
Hi all, 

Been learning a ton about U.P. on my own but no formal education in U.P. 

I have experience in project management (construction, environmental services, IT). What's the best way I can get into U.P. I really want to avoid the masters due to cost. 

Thanks!
Does anyone have a methodology they are willing to share for estimating seasonal population?

I'm doing some work on a town with a big seasonal economy and need to come up with an estimate for seasonal population. 

Estimating seasonal population using ACS data of seasonal units \* average household size brings up a pretty low number, because the average household size of the year-round population is just over 2. AirBnB data shows that the average group in a rental is closer to 10. But not all seasonal housing is short-term rentals. No public utilities so I can't look at usage data.

Thanks for any ideas!
I just got hired for a full time position as a Watershed Planner for a local conversation authority!  I’m so excited!  

Thanks to everyone on this site for the continuing support and inspiration.

Edit for spelling:  conservation
I quickly passed up this job posting because of this line in the job description and didn't apply:

>With a University Degree in Planning or related field, **you will possess or have eligibility for membership** with (such and such)  Milky Way Planning Association / Planning Institute

Now looking back...

Does this mean that I would be eligible  if it will take the 5/6 years to get the (certification) \[American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP)\] as I have a degree,  but not a designated Planning degree and have to collect the years of experience and do the exam to get (AICP) certification?
LVT seems to be really popular among the urban planning community, and it's something Strong Towns advocates for. It makes sense as a measure to disincentivize land speculators who will buy empty land in up-and-coming areas and just sit on it as the value increases around it.

But when I think about how it'd apply in my hometown it would only exacerbate the problems. I compared a house close to the middle of the city and on in a sprawling development on the edge of town, and the land for the house in the denser area was worth almost 3x as much per square foot. So the low density sprawl would pay way fewer taxes, and the high density areas subsidizing the low density areas would get even worse. This would thus encourage sprawl and discourage infill development.

But comparing those same houses the low density house has 4.5x the amount of land area. So if it was a land area tax instead of a land value tax, the sprawling development would be putting more money into the system, and the tax structure would incentivize infill developments in high density areas while disincentivizing low density sprawl.

Is there something I'm missing here? Why is a Land Value Tax more popular than a Land Area Tax?
Hi everyone I'm doing a paper on Daniel Burnham but can't seem to find the full document of his plan for Manila, Philippines. Does anyone know where I can find it? Thank you in advance.
Hi! Non-planner here. 

I live in Baltimore and there is a lot of interest in building an East/West transit corridor, the most popular proposal being a Metrorail subway. 

We currently have a Metrorail line and a light rail line. The Metrorail line runs on the surface (separate grade) for part of the way, then in a tunnel in the downtown areas. The light rail runs on a separate track in suburban areas, with some road crossings, before running at-grade in the city, alongside car traffic, similar to a tram. 

I've been wondering about the difference in cost of laying track. 

It occurs to me that if you have Light Rail running on the surface in an urban environment, it will have to deliberately limit it's speed for safety reasons (road crossings, pedestrians, car traffic, etc). 

**At that point, why not skip the cost of laying track entirely and just have bus lanes with priority signaling?**

The only reason to go underground is to *go faster* because you don't have hazards slowing you down like on the surface. 

***

So let's say you have a tunnel already dug.

For instance, Baltimore's [Highway to Nowhere](https://www.wypr.org/wypr-news/2021-09-16/searching-for-a-turn-around-on-the-highway-to-nowhere), which is often proposed to be capped and repurposed as a subway tunnel. 

You can either put Metrorail in this tunnel, or you could put Light Rail in the tunnel.

From what I'm reading online, I see that Light Rail is slower and has lower capacity than Metrorail.

If the cost of laying the track is roughly the same, then it seems obvious to choose Metrorail because it's faster and has higher capacity.

***

So if you are going to dig a tunnel, the tunnel itself is likely to be the bulk of the construction cost. The tunnel will cost the same regardless of what kind of track you put in it, right? 

Is Metrorail track more expensive than Light Rail Track? 

Are there other significant cost differences between the two that I'm not thinking of - like maintenance?
Recently I've read a lot of articles how digital twins are the future of urban planning. I see that it may helps decision making in a way but I fail to understand why there aren't many cities using them already.   
I'm coming from the game industry and I can see that everything is available to create digital twins in a scalable way, google earth 3d data, mapbox data, public data, etc.  
It almost feels like it's a new buzzword or hype for companies to raise a lot of money without actual value provided.. What do you think?


Hi!

I just got started working as an office intern to do reasearch work for a member of the Maryland House of Delegates. One of my first topics was pedestrian safety around schools. I'd like to know what other DOTs across the country and globe are doing on this topic. I already have a few ideas and case studies I've been looking at but I wanted to ask ya'll for your imput.  Have been passionate about this issue for a while and really want to seize the opportunity to potentially bring change to this community.

This is something I've heard quite a few times on this subreddit (and in other related subs), and I was hoping to read some case studies or research on the matter, particularly in the US context.

A lot of YIMBYs seem to argue that increasing the existing housing stock will decrease the overall cost of housing, but given that many of these developments specifically market themselves as "luxury" (even if we know that that isn't like, a material type of housing and these are built with often shittier materials than what was used in the past), they clearly aim to attract upper/upper middle class (and also mostly white) people. This can and does increase the "attractiveness" of an area for investors and businesses, making real estate prices go up (and rent)

I think it can both simultaneously be true that we DO have a major shortage of housing stock, but also that  the actual cost of housing is much more complicated than the clasical idea of a static supply/demand...  Housing is not priced only according to the use value of the people who live there, but also its utility as an investment asset.  We also know that demand for cars can be induced with car infrastructure... So why can't we also apply that same principal to housing?  As you increase the housing stock and urban amenities (public transportation, bike lanes, corner stores, coffee shops, grocery stores (especially bougie ones like whole foods)), doesn't the demand of an area also increase? How can we promote investment in historically disinvested neighborhoods without also driving out people who live there through market forces? Is it even possible?

This is my main concern with the urbanist movement... While I absolutely agree with many of the points raised about the ills of car dependency and the negative impacts it has on people and the climate, I don't feel like I see enough attention or discussion given to the social justice implications of these policies... Especially with a lot of urbanists being against things like rent control.

While I support public housing, I think we can also recognize that there is often not enough money in many local governments to fund it themselves, and it is so heavily stigmatized that there is not enough political will for it. Also, with "affordable housing development public/private partnerships, as someone  who by basically all measure should qualify for "Affordable housing", in my city, what counts as "affordable" is often not actually affordable, with a minimum income in all of these units actually being higher what I make in a year, lol.

 So instead, I live in a really shitty old market apartment owned by a corporate slumlord that is  the size of a shoebox, is without hot water, and has power that shuts off when I try to run my air conditioner and microwave at the same time. It's also next to a 5-lane car sewer, and our rent was just raised by 200$. 

Anyway, that got personal, my bad. Would appreciate any well-sourced counter-arguments or discussion of solutions to the concerns I have mentioned. Thanks!
I was inspired to make this thread after researching my local transit organization: the RTA (not even an original name), which oversees three separate transit agencies spanning four counties in Metro Detroit. 

Well, "oversees" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that previous sentence, it's basically a do-nothing umbrella organization slapped onto the top of all the transit services here.

It's so bad because the RTA has no power to raise taxes for transit outside of property taxes (which people hate), the 9 member board is appointed rather than elected, it requires a supermajority vote to plan commuter rail and a unanimous vote to plan any other type of rail (like light rail, people movers, or subways which would probably passed if the RTA's ballot measure included more of it way back in 2016).

So, what other terrible agencies are out there? I'm curious to know if the RTA is just uniquely terrible or not.
Quick summary: I'm 30, live in Boston, and work as an advisor in wealth management. I'm an avid participant in the local bike scene and regularly attend town halls advocating for more bike and pedestrian infrastructure. I want to take my financial skills and actually put them towards something I am passionate about, like designing sustainable and equitable cities. 

I think there is overlap between my current role and planning, broadly speaking: staying up to date on current policy/legislation, analyzing the best path forward, advising people who don't always love taking your advice, and partnering with numerous stakeholders (CPAs, attorneys, insurance agents, etc in my current role). 

Do I actually have any chance of getting into this field without a masters degree and no experience? Are there networking events that I should be attending? Any tips on how to get started would be really helpful! Thanks!
So, on vacation in Chattanooga, Tennessee here in the US and Ruby Falls (by the way, must see if you’re down this way), and was reading through part of an exhibit they were setting up focused on the first black photographer locally. Something hit my about a lot of the pushback and NIMBY you see here in the US. Historically speaking, during things like the US’s highway building, and new construction in various areas, it came at the cost of various underprivileged communities, including African American (predominantly) and rural communities. From highways, to rail lines to city expansion. Now I’m not going to get into the “more taxes go to x” and “it makes no sense to be against y,” because I don’t think that’s the main thing here in the US that’s an issue. As the US integrated more in the 60s onward, these stories would’ve spread a bit more, and as the US became more connected with various highway projects, the internet, etc… you’d hear more and more about both the positive and negative effects of various projects. It makes me wonder if this, combined with a history of not really needing to… I guess I’ll call it hyper-urbanize since I don’t know the real word for it…, and that for a country with a large footprint cars did become a great tool for connecting parts of the country that had been pretty divided and short distances the same way trains joined long distance. Basically, I wonder if the US is just a perfect storm to not be open to this kinda stuff.


I am in a bit of a conundrum. We have a downtown that has mild but noticeable issues with overutilization of on-street parking and underutilization of off-street parking. Particularly problematic is employees of local businesses parking on-street rather than off-site.

Now the obvious and definitely the most effective solution is to use any number of financial incentives to steer traffic where we want it, but unfortunately, this is blocked at the political level. So we must instead look at alternatives that keep free parking. We have time limits for the on-street parking, but even getting those was a hard-fought battle.

Does anyone know of any examples of parking management using ONLY free parking? Combing through other municipalities' strategies, they essentially all rely on paid parking to influence behavior (for good reason, but unfortunately not helpful).

Edit: I should note that ALL parking, on or off-street, is free.
I live in a city that is looking to pedestrianize a major street that would also be an important link in the bike network. The street is currently four lanes with fairly wide sidewalks so there is comfortably enough space for both. 

I've been combing the internet for examples and am having trouble finding good ones. I would definitely appreciate some help from the knowledgeable people here. Thanks!


I'd like to talk with other planners about types of pollution beyond air and water. I live in Iowa where wind generators are very common and tonight a board member brought up the way they change the view or skyline (it's really flat here) and she mentioned sight pollution. I often think about noise pollution and light pollution but I suppose I hadn't so much considered sight or dare I say smell. 
What are some other examples of these in your areas?
There's potential for a Dallas-Houston high speed rail route.  But where is the ideal place for the Dallas station, considering the potential for an Oklahoma City and Austin-San Antonio connection eventually?

The current plan is to build a new station near Union station at the edge of downtown Dallas.  Union station has connections to two DART light rail lines and the TRE that connects to Fort Worth.  However it will be surrounded by highways and be about a mile from the central business district.

Alternatively, the area north of DFW has become a hub for transit.  It is currently an area full of warehouses and an unnarrowed flood plain.  8 years ago DART light rail extended to north DFW directly to Dallas, 2 years ago Texrail opened a line from north DFW to Fort Worth, and next year DART  will open a line to the wealthy north surburbs of Plano and Addison to north DFW.  Denton transit also has a right of way to the area.  However, it's currently the middle of no where and much of the area is in a flood plain and highway intersections.

That said, should the train stop at the current downtown Dallas?  Should it ultimately stop in both Dallas and Fort Worth?  Or is it better to create a new transit hub in currently undeveloped land?



Gonna try and make this short and clear-
I live in a pretty small town in California. Everyone knows everyone but we are most certainly growing. People keep moving here, which is great and fine but our town can’t handle it. Our area has the space but refuses to use it properly. Here are my issues
- two nights ago, a girl I knew from highschool passed away in a car accident on one of our straight roads. somebody else died on the same road, in a car accident, the day before. We have had four fatal car accidents within like a mile of each other within about 36 hours. There’s several streets we have that are just DANGEROUS. High speeds straight through, not a care in the world for what color your light is. I’m tired of our community dying and getting hurt, I’m tired of mourning these people that should still be alive. Our town is very spread out. Very suburban, lots of nature but also lots of single story single business buildings, SO MANY houses for single families only, they keep building more, and yet no one can afford them. But they keep building more. They keep tearing down historic nature of our area to build more car washes, storage units, and houses. Our area is so cramped that even coming home at night on a Tuesday at 11:45pm you still get stuck in traffic. It is IMPOSSIBLE to live here without a car. Absolutely impossible. Lots of hills so biking is hard, and the drivers don’t give a fuck about the bike lanes or pedestrians. I know so many people that have gotten hit by a car or almost hit by a car ( including myself). How do I bring it to our city government and start pushing for a change. We need to make living here more sustainable and safe. Enough building more buildings and houses while most of everything else is empty. We don’t need them. These roads are dangerous. I can’t just sit back and watch anymore. It’s miserable here. How can I help make this change?

Edit- forgot to mention we don’t really have public transport. We have a bus that shows up sometimes and it only has like 3 stops. That’s our only public transportation.
Hello,

1st post here! Just looking for e-book or kindle books that anyone recommends about learning about city centre or inner-city urban planning/urban design principles! I would prefer recommendations that have been released post 2020/first wave COVID - but am open to pre-covid if they are your favourite!

Thanks!


The Wire is a television show that depicts the lives of fictional characters in the city of Baltimore Maryland. The show is known for realistically describing how institutions function and disfunction, primarily police departments, drug gangs, unions, media outlets, the education system and elected government. A recurring theme is how individuals inside these organizations keep making decisions that harm society and the institution at large but benefit the individual because of some metric they are trying to hit. Example: journalists making up stories to generate newspaper traffic and get promoted, cops "adjusting" crime statistics to help the mayor look better elections, teachers pushing student scores higher on national exams, etc. 

What if Transportation departments incentivize planners promotions by how many highways they create, how many vehicles their roads service, etc.? Is this something that happens?
I've got my AICP certification and I'm looking to keep up the professional development. I don't really do any environmental planning review in my current role but I want to get more familiar/proficient with NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act). Does anyone know an accreditation process or online class to get more familiar with environmental review?
After listening to todays episode of The Daily which highlighted brain drain from major cities (nyc, dc, San Fran) due to cost of living, I couldn’t help but wonder if there is another pattern of people staying in their metros but moving to outer rings. For example, I live in the NYC area and instead of moving to a city like Nashville, I decided to move further from the city but stay in the NYC area. Is this also becoming a trend and if not, why not?
In the event that a 2 lane road gets congested enough that emergency vehicles aren't able to make it past, and as drivers can't move out of the lane to allow passage in 2 lane roads, how do we design protected bike lanes so they don't impede emergency vehicle access on those roads? In the new world, they typically involve concrete blocks protecting a bike lane level with the road rather than the sidewalk, which can be problematic for emergency vehicles when the bike lane isn't wide enough to accomodate it. 

I'm sure the Dutch have a solution somewhere, but I'm not too sure about the specifics. Do inform me of other solutions too.
I’m planning a trip to Madrid later this year and would like to familiarize myself with the city’s urban planning and development history. 

Does anyone have any recommendations of books in this subject? Could be in Spanish or English.

Is there an equivalent to Jane Jacobs or the Power Broker for Madrid?




Out of curiosity
It seems a little crazy to me that one city has its own unique style of traffic lights in this day and age, especially since the NYC style lights seem to have some advantages when compared to the “standard” ones. Those include wind resistance, since the signal heads are able to move freely while the signal arm is supported by guy wires.
Hi all, this is Kathryn from the Energy News Network sharing an article on Richmond, Virginia's repeal of zoning rules that forced new buildings to have a minimum number of parking spots -- it follows the lead of other U.S. cities like Seattle, Buffalo, Raleigh and Hartford.

Our reporter talked to a city councilor who pushed for the zoning change because he noticed much of the city's parking lots were empty during certain times. A city analysis backed him up, finding a lot of parking was used for one purpose only, forcing buildings to be further apart than they needed to be. With less parking, the councilor thought it would be easier to get around on foot and with public transit, and would help cut transportation emissions.  
  
Clean transportation experts agree, saying the zoning change, combined with Richmond's fare-free buses, are a step toward solving housing and emissions issues.  
  
You can find the whole story here: [https://energynews.us/2023/05/31/richmond-scraps-parking-space-rules-in-an-effort-to-curb-transportation-emissions/](https://energynews.us/2023/05/31/richmond-scraps-parking-space-rules-in-an-effort-to-curb-transportation-emissions/)   
  
We're a nonprofit news site covering the clean energy transition, and this reporter has decades of experience covering this field. I'm happy to answer any questions!

(apologies to mods and please delete if this qualifies as self promo. just trying to share this story with the people I think would be most interested in it!)
Who is attending the Congress for the New Urbanism 31 in Charlotte? I’ll be doing a Pechakucha this afternoon at four along with Andres Duany and a couple other folks, taking about our experience working in Latin nations and communities (I think I’m the sole gringo speaking!).  Come join if you are here!
I live away for college but my hometown is a suburb which is extremely dry. I just came back home after 6 months and I have seen that entire row of trees have been cut down from a boulevard (the only green area in the main town) with the reasons that during the windy seasons, two of the trees uprooted wherein two people were killed and 3 cars damaged. 
The trees are told to be 70-80 years old. 

I had various questions in mind but two burning ones are:
1. Was the measure taken a sustainable one? 
2. What are the other measures that the administration could have taken to deal with this issue?

I know that transit-oriented developments(TODs), including rail-based TODs, seem to reduce vehicle travel, lower the mode share of car users, lower car ownership, and increase transit and active transportation mode share, but this could be due to the other aspects of TODs such as population density, job density, amenities in walking distance, low on and off-street parking availability, proximity to local bus stops, etc. It's a different question altogether as to whether or not proximity to a rail station decreases car usage. Daniel Chatman's study entitled "Does TOD need the T?" argues that the rail transit itself has little effect on car usage and ownership when controlling for the other factors typically associated with TODs like the ones I mentioned. He also argues that rail transit may end up decreasing bus ridership.

A study on rail transit in Hong Kong seems to support the conclusion that the addition of a new rail line increased rail transit usage, but decreased bus usage and had no significant effect on car usage.

[sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692322002496?via%3Dihub](https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692322002496?via%3Dihub)

To be clear, I don't necessarily endorse any of these conclusions. It seems that other cases of rail line additions don't necessarily siphon off bus users. A study done in Singapore showed that the circle line increased rail transit usage, decreased car usage, and had no effect on bus usage.

My question is why rail investments in some cases seem to siphon off bus users and have no effect on car usage, but not in other cases? And does rail transit have an effect on car usage independent of the built environment factors in the area just outside the station(low parking availability, walking distance to jobs and amenities and people, local bus stops, wider sidewalks, bike paths, etc)?
Why does this sub act like Vienna is perfect and glorifies renting or public housing? These buildings just look nice outside but are small inside and have awful utilities. Plus other cities and countries like Hong Kong and Singapore try similar policies and yet cost to rent are far higher. Not to mention actually buying is virtually impossible. I don’t see why this is a good thing just because the city looks pretty.

Surprised that I haven't see this topic come up yet. As everyone is no doubt aware by now, there have been an influx of individuals and families crossing the US border in search of asylum. Many of these families include young children and are temporarily housed within homeless shelters, transitional housing, and hotels as they wait for Federal approval of their application for asylum. They are unable to work, unable to drive, and may or may not be eligible for benefits, depending on jurisdiction, although school-aged children are able to be enrolled in district schools. 

Has anyone had any luck in engaging in any planning interventions to serve asylum seekers? I'm thinking measures like, say, small, temporary pop-up parks on city owned land proximate to where they are housed so that the kids have somewhere to play - obviously, there'd be a need to coordinate siting, easements, potential liability concerns, etc. Or MUTCD-compliant road signage alerting drivers to expect groups of walkers in areas that are typically just considered car sewers/stroads. This is fraught terrain, politically, but I do think that there is a role for planning to play here. I welcome any ideas folks have.
Good evening. Today, I am presenting a puzzle to r/urbanplanning in which we can discuss, contemplate, and perhaps develop a solution to an urban planning challenge in the Republic of Mauritius, namely Hillcrest Ave - in what I dub "**The Hillcrest Puzzle**".

# About Hillcrest Ave

Hillcrest Ave is a 4 lane road with a median (2 lanes on each side). It connects a major suburb to the M2 highway, the major highway of Mauritius, which connects the various municipalities of the island to the major workplaces in the north (Ebene and Port Louis).

&#x200B;

Coordinates: -20.26450289818951, 57.4915383287291 ([Google Maps link](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.2642471,57.4927837,17.72z/data=!5m2!1e1!1e4?entry=ttu))

&#x200B;

* I consider Hillcrest Ave to be an arterial road.
* I do not consider Hillcrest Ave to be a collector/distributor road on the basis that Ave Des Tulipes, Sodnac Link Rd and several other roads feed a lot of traffic onto Hillcrest Ave itself.

&#x200B;

The peak traffic at Hillcrest Ave is experienced on weekdays, during the morning rush (around 8am to 9am, sometimes longer).

* I typically spend a minimum of 45 minutes on Hillcrest Ave each morning as a result.
* A primary cause of this is the backing up of the M2 highway (northbound), which is often occupied with bumper-to-bumper traffic, leading to the Hillcrest Ave - M2 onramp to get backed up, affecting the rest of Hillcrest Ave and the connecting roads as a result.

&#x200B;

However, I do not believe this to be the sole reason behind the traffic, on the basis that:

* Traffic on the onramp flows pretty well. Typically there is a traffic policeman on the M2 highway (a 3 lane highway) directing the left lane traffic onto the middle lane. This frees up the left lane for the onramp traffic to merge rather seamlessly onto the M2.
* Hillcrest Ave gets mostly utilised during the rush hour. If I imagined that M2 was empty, I do not think that the onramp traffic flow would increase more than 2-3x its current flow state.
* On the other hand, outside of rush hour, traffic at Hillcrest Ave is non-existent. This is the primary reason why the urban planning of Hillcrest Ave has never been revisited in the past decade. I believe that good urban planning should be able to better handle traffic at its worst.
* I have observed times when traffic policeman have been around, directing the traffic, that the queue times on Hillcrest Ave drastically reduce (typically a 45 minute wait reduced to 10 minutes).

&#x200B;

# The direction of the traffic and the drivers on Hillcrest Ave

Let's begin at the Hillcrest Ave - M2 onramp. Traffic here comes from 2 paths, both passing through the Hillcrest Ave - Ave Des Tulipes junction:

**1) Hillcrest Ave**

Cars line up on the left lane of Hillcrest Ave to go onto the onramp when the traffic light turns green. Please note that the right lane of Hillcrest Ave is meant to continue straight, however 80% of drivers on this lane often "cheat" and use the right lane to skip traffic, merging onto the onramp slip road after the junction. Police enforcement is non-existent in this regard.

Traffic from the opposite direction of Hillcrest Ave is not allowed to make a u-turn at the Hillcrest Ave - Ave Des Tulipes junction.

&#x200B;

**2) Ave Des Tulipes**

Ave Des Tulipes (north) has a slip road connecting to Hillcrest Ave slightly after the junction. This provides a window for cars to merge and enter the onramp when the traffic is red or blocked (or when Hillcrest Ave left lane drivers give way).

Ave Des Tulipes (south) also has a smaller amount of traffic that heads towards the onramp when their traffic light turns green at the junction.

&#x200B;

**I have observed several things in regard to the above and the dynamics of the drivers on Hillcrest Ave, including myself:**

* Once, a taxi driver on Hillcrest Ave blocked both lanes (occupying the middle of the 2 lane road), effectively stopping the right lane drivers from "cheating". This led to better traffic flow on the left lane of Hillcrest Ave and Ave Des Tulipes. Notably the drivers on the right lane were annoyed at him, but being a taxi driver he didn't care.
* Several times, I have observed right lane drivers, and on several occasions Traffic Police trucks themselves, "cheating" and causing a back up of traffic.
* I used to not cheat, but having observed Traffic Police do it, and watching many others do it, I realised I was stupid to not do so. I now regularly "cheat" and save around 20-30 minutes in my morning commute at the expense of everyone else who are not "smart enough" to "cheat" like me.
* I say "cheat" with inverted commas because the lanes are defined by broken white lines. This means, technically, you are not really breaking any rules. It's not "right" but it's not unlawful to do so.
* The Hillcrest Ave - Ave Des Tulipes junction does not have a yellow box. This means, you are not breaking the traffic laws if you are caught in a standstill in the middle of the junction. Very often this is a major reason why traffic flows get backed up. Opposite direction traffic on Hillcrest Ave cannot turn right onto Ave Des Tulipes (north) because the Hillcrest Ave traffic is blocking the way (courteous drivers will make space though, at the expense of having someone horn/"cheat" around them).

&#x200B;

# My diagnosis of the Hillcrest Puzzle and my proposed solution

I believe there are 3 major issues, that if resolved, could solve the Hillcrest Puzzle:

**A) The use of the right lane on Hillcrest Ave to merge onto the onramp**

My proposed solution: Build a physical concrete divider between the left and right lanes of Hillcrest Ave before and after the Hillcrest Ave - Ave Des Tulipes junction. This will eliminate the use of the right lane of Hillcrest Ave to merge onto the onramp.

However, this will likely result in drivers using the right lane and merging with the left lane before the physical concrete barrier OR merging within the Hillcrest Ave - Ave Des Tulipes junction zone itself. Whilst the former may be manageable, and in many ways it is just a transfer of the issue from one location to an earlier location, the latter could be highly unsafe and dangerous. Therefore, I identify the 2nd major issue below.

&#x200B;

**B) The absence of a yellow box at the Hillcrest Ave - Ave Des Tulipes junction**

A yellow "you should not get stuck here" box is necessary. This would ensure the flow of traffic in other directions does not get obstructed. I do think this needs to be implemented in tandem with an adjustment to the timing of the traffic lights (this may be something I have overlooked - however I am not well versed in the urban planning aspects of traffic lights and their timings, I would appreciate your kind inputs on this area if it is relevant).

&#x200B;

**C) The M2 highway (northbound)**

The elephant in the room. If there was no northbound traffic, Hillcrest Ave would be traffic free (as it is outside of rush hour). Unfortunately, I do not think this is case (as I had outlined above). I may be wrong, and therefore I consider this as an issue. However, I do not have a solution for this. There is ALOT of traffic on the M2 highway (northbound), but it flows.

This article is a week old now, but I’m curious as to what city planners (in particular Australian city planners) think about the lack of rail line to Melbourne Airport. How would you go about fixing the situation? Do you think that Melbourne Airport actually needs its own train station that connects to the suburbs and CBD? And why do you think one hasn’t been built thus far? 

I’m a city planning student from Sydney and I’m quite intrigued about rail infrastructure and public transport in general. I feel like rail infrastructure should be a necessity and connecting it to an airport should be a priority but perhaps things are not what they seem. 

Edit: [LINK](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/20/derailed-again-the-decades-long-quest-for-a-melbourne-airport-train-feels-like-a-mirage) to article.
Hello!  I just graduated college with a degree in forestry and am on track to go to graduate school for urban planning.  Urban planning has become as extreme passion of mine over the past two years and I have so much ambition to be great within the field.  While I have some early, idealist notions of what a great planner should or would be like, I would absolutely love to know what are the differences between average/passable planners and those who are truly greats within the field.

What does it mean to be one of the great urban planners to you?

Thanks!
It just occurred to me how almost all of the city planning pages on YouTube and elsewhere seem to be specifically young or middle-aged white males.

Nothing against this demographic at all..I’m just curious as to why more people from other backgrounds don’t seem to find this topic very engaging.


Major cities in Australia have many parallels w/ major cities in the US and Canada. Everything ranging from the buildings to the road layout, highways, etc. are so similar to what one would find in a similar North American city. 

The suburban neighborhoods in Australia also seem to be so similar to North American ones as well. The homes have a very similar aesthetic, build quality, etc. 

What led Australia to take after North America, and not much of W. Europe, or even many of the Asian countries for urban planning?


Best planned cities around the world that aren't Spanish, Dutch or Japanese?

From what I gather Copenhagen and Singapore are probably top ones but there surely bust be other shinning stars
?
The 'standard' highway capping project takes a chunk of highway that is already below grade and builds a platform above that.

Are there any examples that build above the highway? For example, something that looks like a bridge or something that builds a tunnel around a highway without burying it. 

For example, San Francisco's Presidio Tunnel Top Park is almost like this, where I think they basically build a hill on top of the existing highway (rather than lower the existing road).
I've got a few:

1. Infrastructure upgrades should have precedent over any upzoning

2. Everyone should have the right to downtown amenities which means that CBD's should be as cheap as possible for both renters and owners

3. Zoning should be handled by metropolitan level elected boards instead of nationalized/taken to the state level

4. YIMBYs often times hold water for the excesses of developers

5. It is ideological to assume deregulated markets will produce the best outcomes, so, it's purely ideological to assume that a deregulated housing market will work in the best interests of renters and buyers

For example would the city centres ever have rdeveloped after white flight, Would there still be segregation, And other aspects.
Obviously cars make lots of noise because there’s so many of them, but trains and buses (at least in my town) are individually a lot noisier. So I'm just wondering how this maths out; does transit make less noise on the whole, or are there caveats, what needs to be done, etc. And obviously there are quieter (electric) buses as well as trolleys, so I’m wondering how that factors in too. If you have data that would be great. Thank you.



Great example of actual action happening!!!
I'm looking for numbers on my local town such as; highest density public areas, where most people live at, hell even tax info on buildings and locations. More granular data i guess. I can find general demographics easy enough. Is this even available for citizens? I live in California if needed.
I'm wondering if someone would be able to provide the Land Use Code multipliers (LUC) from ITE Trip Generation Manual, 11th edition, for LUC 210, 215, and 220. 

I am advocating for safer streets in my urban neighborhood and being gaslit/ignored by my city. I have been asking questions over the last \~6mos about the developer's proposal, which represents a a 20% increase in housing units ($650,000+ starting price) in our "blue collar" Ward with absolutely no offsite traffic mitigation included, and my questions have directly resulted in a huge increase in offsite traffic calming improvements such as crosswalks, flashing crosswalk beacons, a signal at a terribly dangerous intersection, lighting, and sidewalks!

I see the Trip Generation Manual costs thousands of dollars - I can't spend that type of money on my quest to make our neighborhoods safer for walkers and bikers/rollers. 

I'm hoping someone here on Reddit can assist so that I can check the Traffic Impact Study for accuracy. The developer only includes the final trip counts, none of the calculations that brought them to peak hour numbers. 

Thank you!

My hometown, Munich, has become a concrete jungle no different from New York City, Detroit or Nashville. It's just ugly. Now, not all cities are like this. Especially in Germany, we still have cities like Passau or Heidelberg with beautiful old buildings, but even they are being swallowed up by modernist crap.
TL/DR: how do I recover from doing so poorly in a phone interview? Is it OK to sent a follow up email along the lines of “I was so nervous here are some examples to your questions”? 

I just absolutely bombed a 30-minute phone screening interview for a Transit Planning role. They asked 4 questions along the lines of 

- Describe your experience with transportation 

- Describe your experience with planning 

- Describe your experience with project management 

I anticipated more behavioral questions for the first interview that these caught me so off guard. 

My mind went completely blank and I am embarrassed by the way I panic rambled my way through. I feel sick thinking about it haha. 

The position was a reach but I do believe I am qualified and would do a great job.

I’m a high school student who is hoping to start an urban planning club but I don’t see many design competitions open to highschoolers. Does anyone here know about competitions, or have any ideas for what an urban planning club would do?
Im starting (community) college majoring in CompSci and minoring in Urban Planning then transfering to finish my degrees. Im really passionate about urban planning and I've been around computers my entire life so it was kind of a no brainer for me. I feel like the CompSci major gives me flexibility for multible different fields of work but at the same time I dont know if its smart if Urban Planning is my passion and It would probobly look better to employers if I had majored in Urban Planning vs. minored.

So coming back to the question, are there any realistic applications for these combined degrees?
Does anyone have a resume template that they have found helps increase the number of interviews they have recieved?

What skills do you highlight on your resume besides ArcGIS products, AutoCAD, or SketchUp?

A couple months ago I graduated with my degree in Urban Planning and a minor in Sustainability. I also did a lot of coursework in GIS so I have some skills there as well but not advanced yet. 

I live in a small city currently with a population around 200,000 people (my husband is in the military and we are stuck living her for the next 2-3 years). Obviously the goal is to move to a larger city when our time here is up but for the meantime I am looking for a job to get my first initial experience in the field.

It’s been tough because there aren’t many job openings for the city I live in. I interviewed earlier this year for a city planner and environmental planner position for a small outlying city and didn’t get either job because they only have 1 other planner and whoever they hired would have been placed on the commission and had more experience. There are no Planner 1, 2, 3 etc, levels here since the city is too small. 

I also applied for a couple GIS jobs and I interviewed for one at a utility company and did not get it due to lack of experience and GIS knowledge (even though the application stated you only need basis GIS skills which I have). 

Anyway, I noticed a neighboring county is hiring for a Planning Associate and Planning Technician 1. Neither position even requires a Bachelors degree but the Associate Planner prefers it. My application has been recommended to the hiring manager and now I’m waiting. Any steps I should take? Should I call them? If so, what should I say when I do?
I live and work in the Washington, D.C. region. I bike about 70 to 80 miles a week and typically drive between 10 and 15 miles. Regardless of whether I'm in the District, Maryland, or Virginia I am noticing more and more drivers disregarding red stop signals. It isn't just one car chasing the yellow and just clearing the intersection as the light turns red. Multiple times a day I witness two and three cars running red lights following that first car.   

**Are you witnessing similar behavior in your USA city or state, or is this madness isolated to people in the DMV?**

In my mind, this all started during the height of the pandemic when some people started leaving their homes and decided empty streets justify reckless driving. As more and more people started driving again they witness this reckless behavior and started adapting it for themselves. Add in a cultural indifference to decorum and law, characterized in the "rules for thee not for me" attitude advanced by so many in power, and the streets are just chaos. 

**Is there anything that local, regional, or state agencies can do to impact this behavior? Or is it too late?**

Thought this was pretty interesting. Would this actually prevent sprawl? I don't know, but it seems like it would certainly make it more tolerable. Key section below:

"A simple, two-sentence subdivision ordinance could actually result in much better places, much better cities. 

***“A block is a portion of privately owned land that is surrounded on all sides by public rights-of-way. No block perimeter shall exceed 2400 feet.”*** 

That’s it. What would the result of this be? Every new development or expansion of a city, or even a new city, would be connected and walkable. It might not be Savannah, ingenuous and beautiful, but it will never, by law, be the sprawling suburbs of the vast majority of 20th century (and unfortunately 21st century) America. In two simple sentences we could have a system that is incredibly clear, simple to understand, administer and build. This won’t guarantee great cities but it will preclude horrible cities."
Do you expect an employer to pay for your AICP renewal certification/membership fees? Or specifically, what if they require an AICP certification as a condition of hire -  should they be responsible for paying fees then? Would you leave the employer if they did not pay renewal fees/pay for conference fees if you wish to attend?

I'm on the fence about this at my current job, a small boutique federal consulting firm. They did not think of these fees during budgeting their bids.
I couldn't find this on Google but I was curious how most cities source their trees? Do they have some contract with a forestry service?
My medium sized city in Northern Illinois is going through a revitalization process, and I am hoping to convince them in adding more neoclassical or neo-gothic infrastructure that is physically and cosmetically appealing. This includes turning dying, vegetation infested areas and/or rotting buildings into beautiful green space markets or sites. 

One of the ideas was to add cobblestone roads. However, I've read that cobblestone roads are very pricey to install compared to concrete. Any ideas for alternatives I can suggest? I'm trying to aim at giving my city a more neogothic European feel, while also including in modern sustainable energy wherever possible. This is something I'd work with local nonprofits and we'd bring to city hall, so ofcourse they will be looking at the $ involved.  Labor is something I and volunteers would try and cover, we'd just need help with material. Thanks!
Just curious about the public versus private possibilities
I come from a small city in WV (metro: ~350,000) and, after moving to Chicago, became very interested in if of quality, grade-separated, transit could be realistically implemented in small to medium sized cities. It seems to me that BRT is a really popular solution at the moment. But could other grade separated options be viable? Airport-style people movers? Something similar to the PRT in Morgantown WV? Or maybe BRT is the answer?

I’m really interested to see what urbanists and planners come up with!
I feel like it’s not uncommon to read news about a state DOTs fighting local governments when it comes to increasing walkability or implementing road diets.  Are there any state DOTs that are not totally oriented around providing car-centric infrastructure?

A lot of renderings / videos / depictions of American highway travel in the 1940s-1950s showed a Jetsons-like world of automobiles freely zipping by on an open road. Obviously, no one seemed to think congestion was a thing back then (or if they did, didn't bother addressing it). In hindsight, it seems incredibly silly that people didn't think congested roads were going to be an eventual reality. 

Does anyone know of any resources, historically, that look into whether engineers in the post-war era accounted for congestion? Or when heavy highway congestion first started being documented? Was there such thing as travel demand modeling / forecasting back then?
I tried searching for this info but couldn’t quite find what I’m looking for so I’m hoping for some guidance from all of you! 

I’m wondering if a planning education would lend itself well to being a Foreign Service Officer for the US Department of State. I recently finished my MUP with an emphasis in economic development and I’ve been reading about Economic Officers with the State Department and it seems like a really interesting career path. I very lightly considered this after undergrad but went a different direction. 

My undergrad degree (7 years ago) was in International Business and I’ve lived internationally 2 different times so it seems like a great fit on paper, but I don’t know what I don’t know, especially when it comes to pros & cons of working at the federal level and promoting American interests abroad. I know it could be dangerous and you “get what you get” as far as assignments which could be in extremely remote areas. 

Just curious if anybody knows someone who went this route or something similar, with a background in planning (or not!) and how it went. Thank you!

Hey guys, I need suggestion of a sustainable approach(s) for solving the issue of illegal and unauthorized street vendors.
I have recently been working on projects around the commercial city centre and economic development/regeneration. I have heard a few people  reference the ideas of Richard Florida, although im sure these ideas have been discounted or at least revised in recent years. Can anyone suggest any books, articles or authors that detail how a city can grow it's economy. Eg, mixed use high streets and high-skilled workers.





The pace of change here is glacial. Housing is politicized and exclusionary zoning is deeply entrenched. Regional planning organizations have zero power, and local municipalities all fight in a race to the bottom.

A century of car-centric planning and a century+ of racist housing and transportation policy has created intractable problems here. We pay more than any other country for infrastructure, and receive far less in return. If you look at how the U.S. is trending compared to every other developed nation—on health, vehicle size, housing costs, pedestrian fatalities, infrastructure investments, income inequality, and on and on—we're going the wrong way.

I want to help fix these things but it's dawning on me that it will take multiple lifetimes to do so. My planning professor in my intro class told us, explicitly: if we want to live in a walkable city, our best bet is probably to move.

I live in New York City, which has the best public transportation access of any city in the US. And yet conditions are abysmal. Subway stations are falling apart and full of mold. Rats everywhere. Trash piles up on sidewalks because we refuse to remove parking spaces for sanitary waste disposal areas. Drivers are aggressive. The program which allowed sidewalk cafes during the pandemic is being scaled back. A proposal to upzone the transit corridor along Long Island was defeated. Cyclists are killed on the streets every month. Last summer, someone was shot right outside of my apartment.

I feel full of despair. I feel guilt for thinking about abandoning planning before I've even started. I feel guilt for leaving my home country instead of staying and making it better. I'm trans, too, and the environment is only getting worse here as I'm excluded from more and more of the country.

It feels like most of the US *likes* their suburbs, their car-dependency, their guns. Why should I try to change that if I prefer something else? Why not move somewhere that is more aligned with my values?

I'm debating whether I want to finish this degree. Debating whether I want to stay in the US.

I'd love to hear from anyone else who's grappled with similar feelings about where you live, and who you plan for.

Edit: Thank you all for the variety of responses here. I deeply appreciate the perspectives and this has given me a lot to think about.
I've been seeing several videos on social media about NIMBYs conflating the 2. I prefer 15-minute cities but combined with smart cities hypothethically I don't really like that. 

To some extent YIMBYs have tried to dispell some myths but I comes off as dismissive or almost deflecting which doesn't come off as convincing. Something like "Where are you getting that from, what's the problem? I'm living it & I'm loving  it". I think directly addressing NIMBYs accusations at least when they're misleading or completely wrong. If some are true at all then may be put it in perspective or acknowledge & reflect.

To clear the air my question still stands.
Hi urban pals!
I have an interview for a long term regional transportation planning job on Tuesday!
I am a permit tech at my current place of work, so I have some experience but nothing in terms of actual planning experience.
Any advice on how to impress or questions I can ask or anything I can do to stand out in my interview?
I would love any advice, I’m nervous but I would love to get this position.
Thank you!!

hello, i am writing a cover letter for a local planning internship and am wondering if i should address it as as "Dear \[Department Director\]" ... it doesnt have information on who might be reviewing these applications such as a "for more information about this position contact \[blah blah\]" so i figured "Dear \[Department Director\]" might work best but it is there a better suggestion? Sorry if its a silly question I might be overthinking it, thanks for any help!
(USA, Midwest) A bit of an unusual post but something I noticed today. In order to get from my grandparents' town to my city, you can either take the large 4-lane state road(?) (I wouldn't consider it a "highway" since it routes directly to commercial buildings which is counterintuitive to the purpose of a highway) or you can take a series of alternate 2-lane country roads. The road is poorly maintained and heavy-congestion, whereas the country roads are well-maintained and low-congestion due to there being more alternative routes depending on which town you are going to.

Both have speed limits of about 40mph, but for some reason we find that more people speed on large commercial-zoned stroads as opposed to the country roads (probably due to the narrower lane width and less space in the clear-zone). 

In areas with less density, like suburbs, why do we resort to the large stroad approach instead of a more varied network of alternate routes and smaller roads? It makes more sense with maintenance and construction, too, since you would only have to shut down one alternative route as opposed to shutting down a portion of a single huge thoroughfare and slow the rest of traffic. In my state: there is always construction, so the major route to go literally anywhere is always miserable and congestion-ridden.

Also to note: state highways and stroads are ugly. "Country roads" are pretty, or at least tolerable.

I don't get the idea behind widening already-huge roads as opposed to building and planning an alternative route. Before our area can even consider adding bus transit or bike-friendly infrastructure (trains aren't always practical), more roads need to become less congested. Instead of thinking to implement solutions to congestion, our legislators are deciding to expand the state highway by 4 lanes.

I'm really peeved by this. Not really sure what to do though as I'm not exactly a professional nor a politician, but maybe someone here would also like to discuss!
The Province of Quebec, Canada, is being held hostage by insurance companies. How? It's about old housing.

My family have a duplex in Thetford Mines, the housing there is quite cheap because of its past with asbestos mining industry. There were some mumble jumble about how this house, with the siding made with asbestos plates, was considered "heritage" despite being by far the ugliest on the street. The insurance company we were with, also thinking the house was heritage, started asking us to do things that were borderline breaching privacy, like taking photos of the house's interior. It came pretty much into harassement level, so we dropped the insurance, just to realize no one else will insure it.

As it turns out, [it became harder than ever to sell old houses in general because insurance companies won't cover the new owners (in french)](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/tele/la-facture/site/segments/reportage/429236/maison-ancienne-patrimoine-assurances-habitation). So it's closer to a systemic issue that requires government intervention.

Last month, we bought a rural house, and as we tried to insure it, once again, the companies won't cover us. The one that does is 3000 C$ a year, with some of the things like fire (I think) not covered. The reason is simply that the house is a century old. The broker we're working with is also pissed at the development and we're trying to bring a change. We thought about contacting the media to condemn the practice, but we'll likely never get an insurance again if we do.

&#x200B;

So despite the situation, we're thinking about selling the house in Thetford, because the ownership of a non-insured house automatically makes us suspicious in the insurance industry's mind. We're treated like frauds. As a result, we can't build our fleet of rental homes, and it's likely going to affect other renters as well.

And the fact it's a systemic issue likely creates artificial scarcity because that's a significant portion of the housing market that can't be put on sale, making them effectively worthless and thus increasing the price of every other one.

&#x200B;

Does that kind of thing also happen in your areas? I'll see what I can do to resolve my problem in the meantime.


Maybe a silly request, I don't know. I recently read a book, *Variations on a Theme Park*, which was a collection of essays/articles on the increasing privatization of space and the effects that has on urban environments and society in general. Really enjoyed the thoughts and topic and would like to learn more. Any recommendations? Thanks! :)

Context: I am an architecture student passionate about urban planning, transportation reform, sustainability, etc. (if that helps in any way to cater your recommendations)
does anyone have any recommendations for london based urban planning podcasts (doesn’t have to solely focus on london) on transportation/infrastructure?
my city has many routes that are mostly not running due to the strike. I had to go to the airport, and it took waiting for the 3rd scheduled bus before one came. I see other riders waiting at stops needlessly, not knowing their bus likely won't come.

The workers striking are working for Transdev.

what can I advocate for my transit agency to do? do they have the power to improve working conditions to avert a strike? Or should I tell them that they simply cannot continue to hire a company that fails to deliver?

Both Amsterdam and Tokyo seem to be great examples on how to design a pedestrian-friendly city with high-density construction. The public transit allows most of the city to be very accessible regardless of where you live, and in the case of The Netherlands, the train system is so solid that you can leave Amsterdam for neighboring cities quite easily with very short commutes. Japan also seems to do quite well on this front. 

So, putting these two up against each other, which do you think has done a better job overall? 

Follow-up: How do Paris and Copenhagen hold up against these two?
In my undergrad my teachers asked us at the start what made us want to become planners. I was to shy to admit that I played theSims and build lego a lot as a kid but a classmate sheepishly did. Which then wound up in the majority of the class admitting that was what they wanted to say and our professor telling us not to be ashamed because that was a very  common answer with younger planners. 

So now I’m just curious to see who else falls under this.
Hey everyone! I’m a planner in Florida finishing up my master’s in planning. I’m wondering if any Chicago area planners or planners from other larger Midwest cities could help me get a general sense for career opportunities up there. I do land use and development review mainly, but also very interested in program-oriented work (affordable housing, redevelopment, etc). 

I’m originally from FL and got a scholarship for grad school here, so it made sense to come back home and start my planning career here (I am a career changer and worked in a different field for years before making the switch). There are a ton of jobs here right now, as there is a lot of development activity. I’m planning on sticking around for another year or so and building up my resume more, but my wife is from the Chicago area and we may want to move up there next year to settle down long term. We’re open to other cities and suburbs though. The cost of living down here is becoming concerning for us and we really enjoyed our time living in the Midwest previously (spent a couple years in Des Moines and sometime in the Chicago burbs too). 

I’m just trying to get a general sense for how difficult it might be to find a planning job up there if we do eventually move. When I do basic searches, there don’t ever seem to be a ton of open jobs in Chicago or many other Midwest cities; I may just be a little spoiled down here in terms of the amount of entry to mid-level opportunities, though. I know the job market can shift dramatically with the economy, but any basic insight would be helpful. Currently in public sector but open to private sector also. Thanks in advance!
Just a random thought if anyone knows. I am someone who lives in the San Diego area (which has a huge housing shortage problem) and would like to research a city/cities that has met this threshold to see what their housing prices are like and use them as a reference point to see what other US cities could be like if they managed to get out of their housing shortage hole.
Seeing all these stories about housing shortages all over the world, it just had me thinking.

Hello all, 

I am looking for book/resource recommendations that explain some basics of civil engineering skills and topics as relate to planning. These are things I wish we had learned more in planning school. I'm not looking to Do Serious Engineering, I just want to more clearly understand how some of this stuff works. 

Specifically, I'm looking for basic/intro resources for things like:

&#x200B;

1. Stormwater/runoff management -- how sites are analyzed and planned for stormwater control, and the mechanisms of each type of management practice
2. Grading/clearing of land and sediment+ erosion control practice 
3. Pavement/Roadway engineering; the physical material and process of building road, sidewalk, path, etc. 
4. How basic city infrastructure like water and sewer lines "work" -- the hierarchy of lines, what different pumps and valves are for, how new taps are added, etc.

Or anything along these lines that you have found helpful. Thanks very much!

My Planning Department wants to get its hands on up-to-date vacancy rate data for the community I live in, but it has been slow-going. We were thinking about looking at USPS data or water/electricity meters if we can find a contact willing to give us that information. 

There's also the US census (of course), but we were hoping for something we could regularly update/reference as opposed to waiting every ten years.

If your community tracks this kind of data (for example, on a month to month or year by year basis), what do you guys use? And how accurate would you say it is?
My medium sized city is very car-centric, so I was hoping to discuss the possibility of testing out piezoelectric energy on certain roads. Anyone's city been able to implement it successfully? And how so/is it going?

Happy friday r/UrbanPlanning! This site was recently sent to me and has been making the rounds in my urban planning graduate program.. it seems to approach the gentrification discourse with a twist. Provacatively titled "ProudGentrifer” it takes a somewhat contrarian stance on this hot topic. Their published critique ‘g-slur: the gentrifer manifesto’ seems to points fingers at the underlying factors that spawn gentrifiers while deploying satire and common gentrifier tropes in their ‘cloud pop-up’ collection. The product descriptions are actually pretty hilarious and states that theyre aim is to spark conversations on the root causes of gentrification and the impact it has on communities.

It did get me thinking tho… as avid urban planning enthusiasts, it’s important for us to explore alt perspectives and meta-understandings, even as they use satire as a tool in delivering their message. I’m sure many of you have seen that viral tiktok recently regarding gentrifcation in NYC (of a bushwick resident from LA being interviewed on the subway), which brought gentrification to the fore of public discourse: “who is and who isnt a gentrifer?”. 

Wondering what others think / reactions are. How do you perceive the weight of structural factors in gentrification, and what responsibility lies with the larger structures at play? Can this kind of satire and “conceptual art” be effective tools in challenging the norm and provoking critical understandings about urban change? Let's have a respectful and enlightening dialogue!
[proudgentrifier site](https://www.proudgentrifier.com)
I've been thinking about this problem and, modernism is known to be closely linked with authoritarianism (communist countries such as USSR or far-right regimes), there are also many countries adopted these principles in the post-war era to offer fast development in undeveloped areas. At the same time, new urbanism is conventionally viewed as leftist, but conservatists also claim that new urbanism truly reflected their values.  Do you think that there is a certain relevancy between planning principles & political ideologies, and is political ideological change the driven factor in changing people's ideals about planning?
Curious, is it always slamming? Or do you complete projects and your looking for something to do in between assignments?
Hi everyone, 

I’m a (24f) urban planning student currently visiting Berlin and I would love the opportunity to chat or meet up with planners, architects, or anyone who is knowledgeable about planning in Berlin (and specifically the district of Mitte) post WW2. 

I’m doing my thesis on this topic, so I’m trying to learn as much as I can while I’m here! 

I posted previously but I think maybe it was too vague 😅 

Thanks so much!

IANAP, just curious. [Reading this](https://web.archive.org/web/20150226200430/http://wiki.coe.neu.edu/groups/nl2011transpo/wiki/794d3/14_Red_Asphalt_Pavement.html), it could make financial sense. A Dutch project manager says their red asphalt costs ~30% more than black upfront but it doesn't need to be painted and re-painted. So it's plausible that could be cheaper in the long run than black asphalt + paint or thermoplastic. There's also an argument to be made that it would be safer in the long run because as paint or plastic wears down it gets less and less visible between re-applications but colored asphalt stays the same. I read it's possible to make green too so the US wouldn't necessarily need to switch from green to red bike lanes and confuse everybody, though I don't know if it's the same price or not. Edit: [Here's one company](https://www.hueasphalt.com) that advertises green asphalt and [here's another](http://www.epsilonpigments.com/news/colored-asphalt-pigments-for-hardscapes-79.html). /u/KyloYen brings up a good point that the environmental impact of each method should also be investigated.
I’m working on an ordinance amendment for a city of less than 25,000 in the state of Washington. We are being directed by the state to work on increasing density and making ADUs more accessible and duplexes possible.

So the more I look at this - what functionally is the difference between the two? 

Our current ADU code allows for an attached ADU (part of the main house either by conversion or addition or original construction) to be of any size within lot coverage, setback and height standards. We require a single parking space for any ADU.

A duplex is defined as two units in the same building, no limitations on size as above, with 2 parking spaces required for each unit.

A detached ADU is currently interpreted as being subject to the same size limitations as an accessory building: 600 square feet, 15 feet in height and at least 5 feet from side and rear property lines, located in rear yard. Requires one parking space.

So based on those standards the only difference between an attached ADU and a duplex is one parking space. 

Also of note, we allow for renters/non owners to occupy either unit in all cases above.

My thought was to allow for duplexes by right in R-1 zones under the current standards, and define an ADU as the detached type only - thereby making the ADU a truly affordable housing option because of its size limitation and lesser parking requirement.

Anyone seen anything similar? See any potential problems with this concept? I’m trying to keep us ahead of state regulations so we can craft something that works for the community and we can relax when any new restrictions come online, knowing we are compliant.

What kind of internships or even clubs would you recommend to get started in this area?

So i'm a county planner on the development review team. We do a 4 day workweek so i've got a bunch of free time, and im debating a 2nd job for some extra money.

Does anyone else have a side hustle going on that works really well? Obviously want to avoid all conflicts of interest (I work for a big county so any consulting is a little iffy), so if you have any tips/warnings/ideas let me know!

As the title says, what businesses tend to be the most successful in small towns? In this case we will classify small as a population of 5,000 and below.
I'm a new federal planner (contractor, not GS side) with about 5 years city planning and handful of years non profit experience. I also have prior military experience . Pay is great, the hours are good with a hybrid schedule, and the bulk (70%) of what I do I'm easily and totally grasping after only a few months with zero hand holding - so no complaints at all. 

What I feel lacking at is the impromptu projects that come across the small team I work in that require some higher level of inside knowledge on federal planning (which is extensive and uses 1000 different acronyms). I feel like I'm sometimes in last place when it comes to generating ideas and bringing a project to its next phase, even with all my experience (I do ask a ton of questions). 

For other public turned federal planners out there, what helped you integrate to be more of a valuable asset? Did you go back to the public side? I sometimes wonder if federal planning is actually my cup of tea. I do miss the daily citizen interaction and jurisdictional hurdles needing navigation but also want to give this a chance to grow on me.

I agree that walkable cities are great, but recently I have seen it pop up everywhere. No matter what topic I look into, it seems like there is always a youtube channel or blog peddling the idea that walkable cities can fix every issue. It feels overdone.

Through my university education in finance and policy, I have gotten the idea that issues can be fixed in multiple ways, and no one policy is one size fits all. But the popular media surrounding the field of planning seems hyper-fixated on fixing everything with walkability.

I know this may be controversial in this sub, but I feel like focusing on only walkability in cities can have a negative impact on the field as a whole. So many other disparities exist that have negative impacts on communities, that also need to be addressed, and aren't immediately fixable by bike lanes and pedestrian safety (even though most popular planning media would have you think so). 

I just want to hear other opinions and see how others think, because I feel like nowadays, most people have been exposed to this side of planning. I was wondering if any planners would be able to answer with their experience and let me know if the idea of walkable cities is really as great as it is portrayed.

Thank You!
to start off; i am passionate about city building, liberal policy, the environment, and social equity through transportation, amenities, etc.

i am a current university applicant, and i want to make a change in the career that i choose. i do like having the freedom to move around a bit (job wise) as well, though.

**my predicament:** i applied to many accredited urban planning programs, and i know urban planning makes small changes... but i have a big, dreaming mind. i feel like the right career for me is something in policy or planning (whether that be environmental policy, policy planning, social policy, etc.), but i don't know which to choose or specialize in.

policy is so bureaucratic and slow moving... *but so is planning*. my issue is that i feel like something along the lines of policy analyst would actually make a difference to the specific field, *as opposed to* urban planning (rewriting zoning, minor variance, checking for compliance, etc). their are definitely crossovers in annoyance between planner and policy analyst though; mainly with compliance.

what are your guys' opinions? i guess i'm just looking for validation. i don't want to end up a zoning / development / cad monkey.

my question for you planners is: is your work meaningful to you? do you **love** or **regret** going into urban planning? is an accredited undergrad in planning worth it, being able to pivot to transportation and environmental jobs easier? (getting jobs like director of planning services would be pretty cool though).

**to add, i know it is much easier to get into policy from urban planning, but vice versa is much harder. that is something for me to consider as well.**

this is a big decision for me, and i don't want to waste the next 4 years of my life.

thank you all.
My living preferences

1. Something like Brooklyn brownstone neighborhoods shared back yard 2 to 3 family townhouse with sporadic retail civic and office space on the ground floor. 

2. Centrally located downtown urban mega complex ideally 800+ units and green space nearby vertical village in a city. 

3. Small to midsize apartment building in a city on some sort of Greenbelt or  waterfront. 

4. Rowhouse working waterfront.

5. Small building near downtown 7 to 30 units


6. Midsize building


I have one really specific question. Apologies if it doesn't fit into the context of the sub.

Boston recently announced their plans to revamp parking in one of the more residential neighborhoods. All good stuff, no complaints. I was reading through the related survey they put out and it mentioned that they asked business owners and employees about how customers accessed the businesses (ex. by car, by transit). That struck me as a clumsy way to find out about customers. Is that how cities normally do this? I suspect the answer is yes, for cost reasons, but it's been gnawing at me. ~~I thought about emailing the department but I figured they wouldn't respond.~~
Hello everyone. I guess the title says it all? 
Do any of you work as a planner in the town that you grew up in? Has that affected the way you navigate your job? Do you still live in that town? Any more you’d like to share or advice based on experiences?

Would love to hear input if anyone has faced this, as I may soon be in the very situation and was wondering how unique that experience is and whether it has had any profound impacts on your daily work life? Thanks!


Edit: Thanks for all the input so far, have some considerations to take. 
Slight bit more context: This would be an Assistant Planner position which is something that is pushing me to accept if given an offer. I currently only have a BA and was “Highly” encouraged to apply due to having been a gis/planning intern at said city prior to accepting my current full time gis analyst position at a consulting firm.
so this opportunity seems like one I’d be silly not to take, as it’s a perfect stepping stone for any future endeavors as well as significant enough salary/benefit increase. Thanks again for the input!
Hey all, 

Been posting a bit the past few days and the answers have been amazing thank you all! Project manager here looking to get into urban planning. I am currently contemplating if I want to pursue a Masters in Urban Planning or gain certifications in U.P. I've got some of the softskills down from my experience as a PM, but is there a recommended list of hard skills & certifications you'd suggest as U.P's? Mainly in these categories:

1) construction knowledge
2) CAD and other technical skills
3) Mapping
4) Other

Thank you!




For anyone interested in the issue of previous planners that are city Councillors or that run for Mayor.

Previous Urban Planner and current Councilor running for Mayor of Toronto is not doing well. Running middle of pack when he started.

Brad Bradford who briefly worked as a Planner (I call 5/6 years brief in Planning after a Masters degree brief) and became a Councillor in 2018 is running for Mayor of Toronto, and is not doing that well.

Ward residents some who voted for him as councilor had a poster opposing him and calling him two faced Brad. Stanger thing is he worked in City planning and not private developer or Consultation company.

Seems he was very buddy with the outgoing more conservative mayor and even voted against a safe street imitative and other things.

I graduated in the fall of 2022 and I continued working at my part time job in my school as a student assistant in the spring of 2023. I communicated to my boss (by telling them) that I graduated and was working at an internship. But they(my boss) just asked me for proof that I was a full time student because HR requested. 

Is there an issue that I continued working? Will I be in trouble? 

Thanks!
I live in a small/ medium size city called Rockford Illinois. Rockford used to thrive during the manufacturing boom, but was unfortunately hit bad and became a Rust Belt City a little while afterwards. Now, the city is trying to rejuvenate itself and revolutionize both it's downtown and the suburbs, and I want to be a part of it. 

As a regular citizen, who is also planning on going back to school for urban planning, How can I take part and help in this endeavor? My goals are to work on providing accessible transportation to and from the city, especially to major cities such as Milwaukee and Chicago. Next, incentivizing both businesses and College level professionals to both invest in the city and stay and work in the city, simultaneously providing business and a Workforce that keeps up with the times. What's important is that this is a primarily Blue Collar town that is turning more and more white collar, so we want to make sure that there is no divide. And lastly, due to the city having the Rock River run right through it, as well as providing more land mass than major cities such as Milwaukee and Chicago, I would hope to use a city such as mine to test run and implement sustainable living resources, especially alternative technology that is still being tested such as the SHARK underwater turbine system or piezoelectric technology on roads (since this is a very vehicle centric city).

What can I do to add more value to my city?
Hi all!

Project manager here with experience in construction, environmental services, and IT project management.  I have been looking to enter the urban planning & development field for quite some time, but dedicating myself to the finances of a Masters right now is going to be tough. I was given some insight that with my experience and bachelors in public relations, I could take part in some urban planning certifications that could help me get entry level or an inter ship. 

What certifications would you recommend? Thanks!

Does anyone know of any contacts near Boston, MA that could help me find an environmental or climate planning job? It's absolutely miserable applying. I get rejection after rejection. I don't have experience because I haven't been able to get hired.  

Could you pass on anyone's emails or job openings? Thank you all so much. I hate this job market. I've hated it for years.  

Thank anyone who reads this.

Ive noticed as of late there is no sign of community in the area i live, there is a few big stores and a town sqaure but outside of that there is nothing. I live in a swedish town with a population of around 7000 (most living downtown) but there is a lack of community or connection between citizens, no signs anyone even lives here, Most streets are dead and outside of shopping centers you will not find a pop up stand or anything of such sort  
  
Ive learned that sweden has quite strict zoning similar to the usa where you cannot start a shop in your yard even if you own the land and we have quite strict density restrictions in most areas. Setback rules around most main roads who used to be for buisness now turned into arterials leading to dead spaces where citizens used to thrive and deppresing gray landscapes nobody wishes to exist in. If you want to start a company you would need to buy a plot of land in a commercial area and than go thru a long process of aprovals to build anything on it. I feel that this makes it almost imposible to start a company as there is to much risk and you would need alot of initial investment which people just dont want to risk, is this assumption correct?  
  
how would one fix this? Id like to speak to the urban planning and political office about changes in community standard to create a more connected and rich area with culture and community but i dont want to give misguided advice  
  
Sorry about bad english, wrote this in a rush

I’ve been scrolling through apartment prices for many European cities. Not the global, cosmopolitan, world class cities (London, Paris, Berlin, Lisbon, Madrid, Amsterdam, Rome, etc) and their super hot housing markets but rather the second, third, fourth tier cities and smaller cities. The more provincial cities with less job opportunities. I came across so many studio and 1 bedroom apartment options under €1000! Granted, they weren’t luxurious but they actually exist and are still livable. 

Comparatively, a lot of second, third and fourth tier US cities outside of rural areas have a very, very limited stock of studios and 1 bedrooms under $1000; the cheapest ones are in the $1000 to $1500 range, typically. You can still find rooms under $1000 but you’ll have a much harder time finding actual apartments on that budget.

This extends to other industries of the US economy. For example, you’ll find a lot of cheaper budget hotel/motel/inn/hostel options in Europe for under €50 a night. In the US, a lot of the cheaper budget options are closer to the $80 to $100 a night. 

Another example is the domestic airline industry. Travel between the various countries of the European continent is facilitated, in part, by a decent amount of cheap, budget airlines. In the US, you also have budget airlines but again, not as many options and also, not as cheap as Europe. Even flying between cities within the same US state can be expensive. 

So why is this the case? Why is the “budget economy” seemingly more extensive in Europe than the US? Why is affordable housing stock in the US so limited even in the smaller cities while smaller European cities seem to still have more affordable housing options?

Hi! I have some concerns that [the protected intersections the Dutch use](https://bicycledutch.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/intersection-2018-01.jpg) with the inwards bend can cause conflicts by confusing drivers about the motion of the cyclist through the junction. Specifically, the idea is that **the inwards bend causes cyclist riding in the same direction as the car to turn right and then left** (sequence reversed for RHD nations), **which would cause the glancing driver making either a right or left turn to mistake a straight through travelling cyclist for a right turning cyclist and then make the turn.** This would then lead to a conflict with the cyclist and driver.

I'm not very familiar with Dutch traffic law so I don't know which direction does the driver have to look first before making either a right or left turn, so I can't elaborate further. If anyone whose familiar with Dutch traffic laws and bike infrastructure, or lives in the Netherlands can address my concerns, that would be appreciated.

Zoning has its problems, like restricting the housing supply and otherwise distorting the markets for land, housing, and buildings--and for that matter, acting as a general barrier to entry for any business, thereby negatively effecting the entire economy to some extent.  Zoning has also caused social problems historically and today, like racism and poor land-use, resulting in environmental damage.  You may be able to think of other problems with zoning.

Since zoning has its problems but there are certain particular zoning ordinances that are good, what if a local government abolished their zoning, but preserved the "good" zoning ordinances by writing them into their code as general laws?  What are the pros and cons of this that this sub sees?
This is an argument I hear a lot, and I need some good counter-arguments.
Hi everyone,

I’ve recently been lucky enough to have been accepted into a summer internship programme at a planning firm in the UK.

I’ve almost finished a degree in sociology and have a brief idea of what an urban planner does, but no clue about what the actual job would be like.

I’m wanting to research the topic a little before starting so I know key terms and am not absolutely clueless - So…does anybody have any advice or suggestions for things that I should know before starting? It’s a big deal for me as this could potentially lead to a job.

Thanks everyone!
Densification of urban areas is particularly difficult depending on how complex land ownership is and fractured it is. 

Do you guys know of any good case practices, articles, legal articles, methodologies, strategies- anything that covers and discusses the issue from any field or profession?
I was having a discussion with my friend about the logistical impracticality of EVERYONE owning their own house, an entire home, and he brought up the point that (we're also roommates of two years, renting a house) very few people want to be in an apartment. You can't dance through your kitchen without three other people getting pissed at you, you can't have sex without everyone knowing about it. People are starting to select the "don't speak to me" option on ride sharing apps, why would they want to live wall to wall?

Is there a realistic housing option that solves this issue without having single family homes dotted across every free inch of land?

Edit : Holy crap everyone thanks for the replies! I'm loving the discussions :) It's interesting to see that apartments really do work, they just have to be built correctly. Everywhere I've lived, seen, or even heard from people living in, have all had issues with privacy. Glad we still have a forefront for the movement towards denser and more ecological friendly housing :)
I run a YouTube channel called Heartland Urbanist about urbanism in the Midwest. I interviewed Megan Owens from Transit Riders United, Detroit’s transit advocacy organization, about the 2016 initiative that came within 1% of transforming Detroit’s transit - and why this is the most promising moment for Detroit transit since then. Check it out!
I just came from the Beltline today and like usual Ponce City Market is booming and full of customers. This seems to be the case with any urban shopping center I visit, while suburban malls around the metro are trying to ride the trend and turn their parking lots into housing and mixed use developments. Malls didn’t die. People still frequently visit urban shopping centers. They just don’t go to indoor suburban shopping malls anymore.
Hello!  
  
I keep hearing about how some cities in the US (Detroit, Syracuse, Buffalo) are removing highways from their cities. I live in Philadelphia and no such plan has been proposed although I676 arguably causes more harm than good.  
  
I'm wondering what state, federal, and local laws/regulations keep these interstates in place? If the state and cities decided they wanted them gone, would the federal government get involved to try to prevent it? Would they withhold funding to do so?


Is there anything stopping state government from 1) buying land; 2) overriding local zoning to allow for a variety of housing options/mixed uses 3) laying out streets and lots (including for future parks and schools); 4) building necessary infrastructure (sewer); and 5) selling off lots for development? This would be a way to address not only undersupply of housing, but also cookie cutter development (prevented by allowing a single developer to only buy a small percentage of the lots), bad street design, and poor land use in general. 

Developers simply don't build good neighborhoods on their own accord (except in rare instances). Government, it seems to me, can *force* good neighborhoods to be built. They just need to have the vision. After all, isn't this how it used to be?
Hi! According to both the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/work-travel-time.html) and [data from the Mineta Transportation Institute](https://sjsu-mupers.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/392edde4f2154ca78226fb81d97e40e3), commute times are longer in cities with better transit service and greater density if you compare it with the Census data on density ([sorry for using Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population_density) as I can't find the data from the Census itself).

Isn't this potentially a negative of the increasing density that is necessary for walkable cities? How would this be addressed? 

EDIT: I didn't mean to imply that such a correlation equals causation. Sorry for that
Just a normal guy that's very interested in urban and municipal planning.

My municipality is updating its land use by-laws and my area is slated to allow up to 4 units. There are also provisions for ADU's.

But my entire subdivision is under restrictive covenants that include, "No building shall be erected on the said lands other than a detached private dwelling house to and for the use of a single family"..... and "No more than one dwelling house shall be erected or stand at any one time upon any one of said lots".....

Would the restrictive covenants supercede and future land use by-laws? Is our entire subdivision just going to be left in the dark ages in terms of this? We're only 1km from the urban area and the new zoning is labeled "Urban residential 3", where multi-dwelling units are encouraged. But this seems impossible, no?

I would love to add an ADU for family to use when they visit as well as for a studio/play space for my kids, but that also seems like a no-go.
What are the thoughts on the idea of underground bike routes, similar to a metro route but with a cyclable tunnel rather than rail tunnels? Does anyone know if anything like this already exists?

I like the idea of an easy, safe cycle route protected from traffic, the elements, and away from pedestrians with no need to stop en route. It also offers more independence (e.g. not having to stop/wait at each 'station') and has the advantage of not being public transport which (sadly) dissuades a lot of people. It also gives people the option to exercise regularly too. Naturally it would have big start up costs and maintenance wouldn't be free, but metro lines also need the same and require more staff/specialist drivers etc.

It's likely I'm missing a glaringly obvious (potentially fatal) drawback or issue with the idea, which is also why I'm posting here, so give me your thoughts!

Edit: This suggestion is a comparison to a metro system network where one or the other would be built, and therefore money would be spent on the underground infrastructure anyway. This is not a replacement for ground level cycling infrastructure, which I also believe strongly in.

I keep getting mixed responses about the difficulty on the AICP. Yes I do get that everyone one is different but usually for test like this you usually have a general consensus of “Wow that royally sucked” or “wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be”. One of my professors for my masters program thinks its a joke (hes an engineer with a PE so I take what he says with a grain of salt sometimes), my mentor said she that it was hard but passed on the first try and some coworkers and friends and mentioned it kicked their buts and had to take it more then once. It truly is a mixed bag.

That being said about how much time did you dedicate to preparing for the AICP? A month, 6 months, a year? Longer? Was its enough, overkill or too little time? I am planning to sit for it May 2024 🤞🏼 and am trying to see when I should plan on seriously buckling down to study.

?

I know that this is common topic in this sub, so apologies for some repetition but as the title says, what are your must have books?

For the past years I’ve been thinking of start collecting books and absorbing all their knowledge. I’m a researcher, so I quote some books and have a lot of books in digital form but never got around to actually buying the books and have a physical copy. I want to change that! I want to read them from start to finish for recreational purposes and not just for work purposes.

All sugestions are welcome! Old and news. Thanks!!
Hey everyone,

I'm a university freshman looking for employment for my sophomore year. I'm trying to think of entry-level positions that are vaguely related to planning. I would love to do an internship with my local planning agency, however, I think I would need upper-division standing :/

 The work would also need to be flexible in hours since I'm taking a full load of coursework.

So far I was thinking maybe a position in community outreach with my school's Associated Students department, or maybe getting a job with Public Works as a general laborer. I was also thinking about something related to CAD or GIS, however, all these positions seem to be really competitive andddd I don't think they're really looking for a 19 yr old without any experience LOL.

What kinds of jobs did you all work during college? What types of jobs proved useful in your career/ understanding of planning as a discipline? 

I know there's not huge pressure to get something on my resume that's hugely related to the field since it's early in my education but the last couple jobs I worked in food service were just really unfulfilling. I think it would be cool to have a job that aligns more with my interests.

Also... I would also appreciate any leads on any opportunities/organizations I could explore that are in the Bay, preferably near SF.

Thanks !!!! :D
I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I’ve been wondering as I’ve started travelling. I’ve noticed that wealthy suburbs in other countries will have large, beautiful homes… right next to each other. While this can happen in some densely populated areas of the U.S., in suburbs of New York, Boston, Washington DC, etc., it’s considered highly desirable to have a large plot of land to go along with your large house. This doesn’t seem to be the case in other countries.

I know in European and Asian countries for example it could be because they simply lack the space. But I’m thinking of Canada and Australia… similar countries with large houses and lots of land, but you look at wealthy suburbs of Toronto or Melbourne and houses are right on top of each other. Why is this? Why do Americans have so much more land?
Which projects? When in the process? What sort of information do you hope to collect?

Basically, when does it improve the outcome of the project vs. when is it just a procedural checkbox?
I have an upcoming interview for an entry level planning position within my current organization. It is a bit of a career pivot for me—I don’t have a planning degree—but I believe the job is well within my abilities. That said, do y’all have any insights on what sorts of questions to anticipate? This is the second round of interviews, before a panel of five people, so the stakes are high! Thank you everyone!
I ask this for a few reasons: 

1. the recent legislative successes in states like California and Montana (NY would be a counterpoint) 
2. how difficult and piecemeal positive changes are at the city and county levels vs the goliath that is the last 70+ years of sprawling car-centric city design
3. the balkanization of our cities can make positive change in our localities not as impactful

Of course it is good to be active locally no matter what and I have definitely seen some positive change. I'm really thinking ROI for your time and energy. Also, I have dealt with local officials before but I've never interacted with anyone at the state level so i don't know all that is involved on that side of things.

Hello! I have a background in international development, and have multiple experiences working and conducting research abroad. I have recently become more interested in urban planning, but would still like to stay involved in international work as it’s something I am passionate about and have the skills for, so I’ve been trying to see if I can meld my two interests. What do jobs look like in this field/do they even exist? Thanks in advance!

I live in WV in exurbs of DC/Northern VA area. It’s commutable and there’s recently been an influx of people moving here during/post Covid, although it’s grown for decades.

I moved here awhile back and bought an older existing house. I don’t want to be a hypocrite, but it gets frustrating seeing these big developers (allowed by local county gov) creating similar issues that happened in VA/Md over the decades.

Basically, local county officials: 
- let a corporate developer put in hundreds of homes on two-lane country roads surrounded by farms
- do little/none road improvements to roads, schools, EMS, etc.
- prices go up, people move further and further out. Sprawl continues 

I don’t want to sound like a hypocrite because I also moved to buy a house but I came here because I wanted to be in WV. Whereas some just come for more affordable housing but they’d live closer to DC if they could. I also feel like my home is not the typical suburbia/cookie cutter housing. (I live in woodsy/mountain area of the county vs new developments are in the valley/flat land with no trees.

I want to be realistic as I know that growth is going to occur but it’s just frustrating when this happens and you see what it did to nearby areas, yet the county commission is run by a developer and overall seems to push for rapid growth vs sustainable/efficient growth. 

Also, if we’re going to grow, can we at least get local businesses/services rather than just become a bedroom community where people commute on already clogged roads since there aren’t many jobs here.

The other thing is my area gets a lot of tourism from city/suburbs because people want to get away from the suburban mess yet I fear this area is becoming just that.
 The US and Canada seems to have kind of a "McDonald's" model of housing construction, where the focus is on speed, cost, and quantity. Unfortunately, in many cases it does sacrifice quality (poor soundproofing, weak insulation, poor structural quality, etc.).

As I understand, in many W. European countries, houses are constructed more from brick and cement, as opposed to purely wood, as they are in N. America. Does this result in longer construction times?

So, ultimately do European construction methods manage to juggle speed and quality effectively?

This is something I've heard a lot.  Obviously American and Canadian cities aren't nearly as well urban-planned as their European and Asian counterparts, nor is their public transit as good.  However what surprised me is that even NYC isn't that good (though obviously its the best planned and transit city in North America).  Why is this the case, and what does it need to improve upon?
I'm currently undertaking a mock urban design project to help secure a job in the field of urban design (I'm an architecture graduate).

The location I have chosen is in Tanzania, Africa. The site is located next to a poor community, perhaps a little richer than your typical slum. The neighbourhood which I'm designing is also not intended to be populated by the richest inhabitants of the city, however there will obviously be some disbalance between the quality and wealth of the existing community and the one I am designing.

My goal is to ensure that the edges of my designed neighbourhood are as welcoming as possible. In other words, to create the opposite of a gated community. I do not want to create a scheme which sticks out like a sore thumb and creates unnecessary hierarchies between neighbouring communities.

Does anyone have any ideas or relevant precedents on how to design neighbourhood/community edges that are inviting rather than unwelcoming - for example, using a park to draw people in?

Thanks.
Is it harder to make a public transit heavy system in hotter tropical cities, since people are less likely to walk to reach the stations?

For example, in a better climate or even when the weather's nice in my city, I can walk 1-2 km to reach the metro station easily. But most of the time, it's too hot that a 15 min walk to the nearest metro would have me drowning in sweat which is why I prefer using my car.
Hey all, I'm finishing up the path I took to study for my AICP exam which is this upcoming saturday. I'm planning to review my materials one more time, but I am curious: Is anyone familiar with any resources that are much more last-minute review or study guides? Pretty much something I can wrap up with this week to give me that extra confidence boost for the test. Thank you!
I tend to deep dive into a topic I'm excited about for maybe a month at a time. I believe this next month will be devoted to urban planning. I'm obsessed. Not trying to change career paths or anything, but perhaps I want to be a super informed citizen and advocate. I'd love any guidance on how to best inform myself like Youtube playlists that go more in depth, books I should read, people I should follow on social media, blogs, etc.

Topics I want to learn more about:

* **Sustainability** \- I just think that it's stupid how much we rely on cars in the US. I also think it's stupid that we like throw away food scraps and leaves when they can make compost with like 0 effort. How to implement smarter, more efficient changes at scale and incorporate into design/planning?
* **Community building** \- I think people are becoming so isolated. We act like suburban homeownership is a dream but people don't have community like they used to. I think public spaces and planning can naturally bring people together and improve overall quality of life. What can make this happen?
* **Zoning and Policy** \- I could design a Utopian city in my mind, but in application that's not really how it works. How can cities/governments implement or remove policies that can encourage a more walkable, sustainable, communal place? I think that ideally buildings are consistently between 3-5 stories with the ground level as commercial space and the top levels as apartments. What are the barriers that keep us from pulling this off? What changes can make this happen? What examples are there of successful policies?
* **Getting involved** \- Like I said, I don't want to change my career, but I want to know how to be an advocate. Are there certain types of city meetings that I should attend? People I should meet? Groups I should join? How can an individual best support positive change?

I've been thinking a lot lately about positive change I want to make in the world, and the more I think about it the more I realize how much happier society would be with better planned cities. We need community. We need sustainability. We need good health. We need access and equity. Thank you for reading.

Info: I currently live in a fast developing suburb, but next year I'm moving to Miami.
Prefabricated concrete was used for mass housing in the past as it is cost effective. However, I live in a warm country and summer temperatures exceed 45 degree Celsius. That is why I am concerned about the "urban heat island" effect. Can modular bricks (made of baked clay) be used instead of concrete and still be cost effective and build more homes in a short amount of time?
So, in some time Ill be graduating from a Portuguese university in urban planning. Im not specifying which and when because I really dont feel like doxxing myself.

However, I need some help. Portugal is very open and clear with communication and the letter of their laws through "Decretos do Lei" publications in Diaria das Noticias. Law declarations in a national notice paper.

My thesis will be related to rainwater management, flood reduction and flood impact mitigation. Does anyone here know of any Portuguese Decretos do Lei regarding this field of urban planning?
It's common for vehicular cycling advocates such as John Forester to cite research that proves that the accident rate for vehicular cyclists is lower than that of general cyclists.[In this article](http://web.archive.org/web/20071120043502/http://johnforester.com/Articles/Facilities/Pucher%20Revs.htm), he writes:

>***Pucher's words: "Twice you claim that vehicular cyclists have accident rates that are a fourth or a fifth the levels for cyclists on separate facilities***\*; clearly that needs to be clarified, very specifically\* ***stating that you mean well-trained vehicular cyclists***\*, not just any cyclists using the regular road network (which is clearly the vast majority of road cyclists in the real world); and of course, you need to cite the exact extent of the sample you choose, timing, and precise reference. If this is just one or two isolated studies, that needs to be noted, since it means they cannot be overgeneralized."\*  
>  
>*I have never made the claim that Prof. Pucher has stated, neither for the groups he has stated nor for the facilities that he has stated.* ***I*** *do not* ***describe the select group as*** *"well-trained vehicular cyclists," but as* ***a group whose members are more likely to operate in a vehicular manner than is the general cycling public.*** *Fewer than 1% of the select group had ever had training in vehicular cycling.* ***They had acquired vehicular cycling habits from experience and from cycling with their clubmates.*** ***Their accident rates are only 20% -25% of those of the general population.*** *The data come from the USA and Britain, areas where very little of the cycling by the general cycling public is done on separate facilities.*

[He elaborates on his argument in one of his books:](https://archive.org/details/bicycletransport0000fore/page/48/mode/2up?q=survey)

>*Three surveys of cyclist accidents provide general accident- rate data. Chlapecka, Schupack, Planek, Klecker, and Driessen's survey of elementary-school children showed that* ***elementary- school cyclists averaged 580 miles per year at an accident rate of 720 per million miles.*** *Schupack and Driessen's survey of college cyclists showed that* ***a general population of students and other college adults averaged 600 miles a year at an accident rate of 500 per million bike-miles.*** *These college adults also reported a fall rate of 6% per ride, a value that astonished me and astonishes the bicycle-club members I speak before.* ***Kaplan's survey of League of American Wheelmen cyclists showed that they averaged 2,400 miles per year at an accident rate of 113 accidents per million bike-miles.*** *There is little difference between the accident definitions used In these surveys - students were asked to report all accidents with either injury or property damage, LAW cyclists were asked to report all collisions or serious falls.*  
>  
>*These surveys disprove the notion that for cyclists in general deliberate risk-taking is a significant cause of accidents.* ***Of the students over age 16, those most likely to take deliberate risks had the lowest accident rates, while those least likely to take deliberate risks had the highest accident rates.***  
>  
>\- Forester, Bicycle Transportation p.49

As club cyclists tend to be more experienced with cycling in general, and more experienced cyclists are less likely to take unnecessary risks and be more risk aware, it is likely that Forester engaged in the self selection and survivorship bias in his analysis.

Now granted, his end point is that this proves that we ought to train cyclists and potential cyclists more and better to get them more comfortable with vehicular cycling. But I do think the safety is overstated by the fact that such an activity will weed out those lacking in confidence and skills required to engage in vehicular cycling.

What are your thoughts?

Forester's cited studies:

1. Chlapecka, T. W., S. A. Schupack, T. W. Planek, H. Klecka & J. G. Driessen; Bicycle Accidents and Usage Among Elementary School Children in the United States; Chicago, National Safety Council; 1975
2. Kaplan, Jerrold A.; Characteristics of the Regular Adult Bicycle User; MS thesis, U. of Maryland; FHWA; 1976; Springfield VA; National Technical Information Service
3. Schupack, S. A & G. J. Driessen; Bicycle Accidents and Usage Among Young Adults: Preliminary Study; Chicago, National Safety Council; 1976

This seems to be a mostly US centric thread but i saw some UK posts as well so i'm just gonna ask here

I've been looking at jobs in the field just doing my research and consideration Planning Consultant as a viable position until I found Planning Enforcement Officer. I think this suits me perfectly! I really like the policy side vs. the design side and I've worked in visa compliance for a bit and this seems similar in terms of the kind of day-to-day responsibilities and I was pretty good at it too.

❓ I'm wondering if there are any Planning Consultants/Enforcement Officers here to give advice on how to get a job as a policy enforcement officer? It looks like a council job but I've also seen some private company's with this position? Would love some clarity. 

Cursory research shows this job also seems to have a higher salary range (i may be wrong though) than other graduate positions seem to have which of course appeals to me as well haha.
So I know this period of time was a pretty massive blunder for city planning, however, it has always intrigued me. I've always found weird midcentury urban renewal neighborhoods like Detroit's Lafayette Park to be interesting to look at. I was wondering if there's any good books about midcentury urban design ideas, I'd like to learn more about this period and would like to examine what things went wrong with it and compare it to modern planning ideas. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know, thanks!

When i decided to major in city planning i was under the impression it was a growing field with a good outlook. Now it seems like I see so much conflicting information, some people say it’s almost impossible to get a decent paying job and other people say there are a lot of opportunities. I’m not going into the field  for the money, i am passionate about it, but at the end of the day I do need a job that can support me since I have nothing to fall back on. I’m just worried about graduating in the middle of a recession and not finding work, currently i’m a sophomore in undergrad so if i’m going to change fields i have to now.


I've been thinking about Reece's recent video (that I'm sure you've all seen).

Too many transit advocates fall into this double standard with respect to transit funding, versus road funding. While roads are understood to be a sunk cost - something the government should obviously provide and something that shouldn't turn a profit - transit is expected, even by many transit advocates, to be something that should at least break even, if not turn a profit. 

Transit projects get bogged down in feasibility studies. We wonder whether suburban or exurban communities deserve to be connected to transit at all - afterall, will the service *even* break even?

Yet, we don't do a feasibility study for every road project. We don't consider whether the road will have enough users so as to break even on the cost of building and maintaining every road or freeway. Ask yourself this: if you've never batted an eyelash as to whether your neighborhood thoroughfare makes money, why did the latest transit project get shot done because there wasn't a prospect of making a profit?

The fact is, roads, sewers, schools, hospitals and, yes, public transit, are basic government services that shouldn't be expected to be profitable or even break even. Yet I've seen too many transit advocates say things like: if a bus doesn't have standing passengers, it can't sustain its existence.

Obviously, I am not saying every suburban street should have a metro. I'm not suggesting that we should provide 2 minute bus frequencies on every farm road. What I am saying is that we shouldn't expect every transit route to break even, and we certainly shouldn't expect them to make a profit. 

There's a balance, of course, between deciding how much to reasonably invest in transit and insisting that a route shouldn't exist unless it will have a fare box recovery ratio of 1 or more. All I'm suggesting is the same cost benefit analysis that we engage in every time we consider whether a school, hospital, sewer or road should be built.

However, there's another side to this coin: those would that would treat transit as a *social service*. I'm not suggesting this either. While transit may not be a profitable business venture, neither does it need to be a social service only for the poor and the desperate. Transit should be a competitive alternative to driving - and that means investing in speed, frequency, comfort and coverage. Treating transit as a *public service* rather than a social service or a profitable venture.

Transit advocates often draw a false dichotomy between seeing transit as a social service - and rightfully pointing out that transit needs to be a competitive alternative to other modes if it is to succeed. But then fall into the trap of assuming it should be a profitable venture. But the reality is, the obvious third way has been under our noses this whole time: seeing transit as a public service, as we see hospitals, schools, sewers, sidewalks, streets, roads and highways. 

As a final clarifying point, I'd like to say a brief word about free fares and adjacent topics. Some transit advocates in a similar vein have suggested free fares. Many public services are free at the point of use: sidewalks, roads, highways,  hospitals and schools are often free at the point of use. At the same time, many public service are not: roads often have toll lanes, many countries with universal healthcare have small, affordable copays and insurance fees. While I am not saying there's never a case to be made for making fares free, the public will be served better by affordable, *high quality* transit rather than free, *low quality* transit. Some areas might be able to have free, high quality transit, but this isn't a reality everywhere. For those who are very young, very old, low income, those with disabilities, we can have free or subsidized fares. But we shouldn't necessarily push for making all transit free at the point of use in all or every circumstance. 

Thank you for attending my Ted talk.

Planning and Design Startup

Hi all,

I have worked as a planner for an economic development district for about three years. I have gathered knowledge about how planning firms operate at lease from the project side. I think at this point I want to start my own planning and design business.

Any information i get here would be helpful!

My group wants to remove some parking spaces to reduce the car presence on a beach block. Fewer cars will be safer, quieter, nicer to walk around to the shops. 
But the city balks at removing the spots because of the revenue source. 
Any ideas? It’s better for the town, but how do we deal with revenue loss?

It's no secret by now that there are some tech sector developments on the way are likely to disrupt a lot of planning in some form over the coming years - whether it's because of AI generated public comments submitted in a volume that completely annihilate staff's capacity to handle them, or via the ability to feed a 24x36 site plan PDF into an algorithm that spits out how it does or doesn't meet a given zoning envelope and suddenly makes development review planners less valuable, or something else. 

Zoning codes suck to read. Whatever the opposite of life affirming is, that's what reading zoning feels like (I say this with nearly 20 years in the field). What if we do less of that? Well, try this for starters:

 \- Feed the zoning code PDF into [ChatPDF](https://www.chatpdf.com/) (it's just a drag and drop)

 \- Then, ask it questions (how many stories of height are permitted in an R-2 district? What is the minimum sidewalk width requirement along collector streets? How large does a setback from a DEC wetland need to be?)

It'll then answer you, succinctly. It can be a little wonky, but it seems to actually work. I've been keeping a tab open all day with the code PDF loaded up and it's already saving me time and mental energy. 

BTW I do not work for this company, I'm just a public sector planning grunt in the trenches looking to make life a little easier on staff and embrace ways to reduce drudgery so that we can tackle the fun stuff.
A common paper cited by vehicular cycling advocates is [this Danish paper by Jensen et al.](https://nacto.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Cycle_Tracks_Copenhagen.pdf) that has found that separated bike lanes lead to a +129% increase in right hooks and a +48% increase in left hooks. The paper reports that in conjunction with other types of accidents involving cars and pedestrians, this has led to a 10% increase in accidents from before the bike lanes were constructed. TBF, most of the increase has came from accidents involving bus passengers and cyclists, and it notes that the removal of parking increases side street turns and thus accidents. But vehicular cycling advocates point to this to prove that bike lanes worsen safety.

Have any of you encountered this study before? What are your thoughts?

Hi all, 

So I am a Planner and GIS practitioner by trade. Recently got back into planning after a stint in GIS... specifically, I am in transportation and I am in the US.

I'm looking for resources to keep me up to date with Best practices, learn from, etc. Luckily my job will cover my APA membership and I plan to do CUs and subscribe to JAPA.

What are some other resources I should look into? 

Thanks in advance!

Hi folks! Hoping I can pick your brains for some advice. 

I've been working for 10+ years (undergraduate degree in economics, started my career in human resources and worked in various HR roles for about 5 years before moving into tech consulting). I never really had a plan - I just kind of stumbled into every job I've had. 

Perhaps in somewhat of a midlife crisis, I'm re-evaluating my path and trying to think about what I really **want** to do. I've always been fascinated by cities. As a small town kid on my first trip to New York, the tourist attractions were great, but what what really amazed me was how it all just seemed to work. So many people in such a small space, getting what they needed and getting where they needed to go. Since then, as I move about my city, I find myself constantly thinking about how our environments impact our quality of life, and I think perhaps working in urban planning could be something I'd really enjoy.

Realistically, is it possible to move into something related to urban planning without further education? Are there non-degree / certificate programs that may give me an advantage? Non-planning but planning adjacent roles that may be easier to transfer into with my HR / tech / consulting background?

Thanks in advance for any insights!
I’m interested in urban planning but I kind of want to see what a day in the life of an urban planner would be like, what they do, and maybe talk to one for a little bit about it. Is it possible to find someone who I can job shadow (follow around for the day) or is that kind of thing not desirable in this field? I really want to get a feel for it but I don’t want to annoy anyone. 

I’m in the US for context.
So Im watching NFKRZ' new video on his holiday to Thailand and some things strucks me as relatively weird.
Ive never been more eastern than Turkey and I know virtually nothing about Thai culture except some culinary things. But his videos show a very weird urban design. Streets which seems completely designed around cars with little barriers or verticality, but have been overtaken by pedestrians. Is this just because this city is so touristic, or is this "squarification" a normal thing in Thai nightlife areas?

Furthermore, Roman commented that he didnt see any  or much filth on the streets, while the streets were also (according to him) barren of garbage cans, be they domestic or public use.

Can someone  explain this for me?




The Town of Munster, Indiana, is seeking a highly qualified individual to serve in the exciting position of Planning Director. Munster is a suburban community that is home to 23,000 residents, two regional hospitals, and an award-winning school district and is located less than 30 miles from downtown Chicago. 

We are a busy community looking for a seasoned and energetic professional that can meet the potential of our opportunity. 

In addition to the daily essential functions, the Planning Director will be involved in several major projects that are underway:

A study titled “Dirty density: Air quality and the density of American cities” argues so. 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069622001206#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20dense%20urban%20living,result%20in%20higher%20pollution%20exposure.

https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2019/08/15/when-it-comes-to-harmful-air-pollution-denser-cities-arent-greener-cities/


They argue that while compact cities are associated with lower per capita greenhouse gas emissions and VMT, this is offset by the concentration of air pollution. According to the authors, for a fixed level of per capita emissions, increasing density will increase exposure to air pollution. The authors also argue that the costs of air pollution on our health outweigh the climate change benefits of density.

To be clear, I’m not saying this study is correct or that we need to suburbanize. But if its conclusions are true, how should dense cities keep both the climate change benefits while minimizing the air pollution exposure costs? And are there any criticisms of the study?

I’m starting to see a trend of suburbs and other sprawled territories taking an interest in, for a lack of better words, retrofitting their streets and zoning laws to allow for more density and better pedestrian accomodation. Am I jumping the gun and this is just local to me or are yall seeing the same thing?
Hello,

I'm trying to find out how developers/designers/planners justify building height and costs as I'm interested in advocating for denser residential and mixed-use development where I live. I've been told that 8 story and above buildings are now considered too expensive to build and that developers are interested in building shorter buildings. But as a layman in this area, I'm having trouble understanding why? (or if my understanding of things is even correct?)

For example, in my area I've seen 10 story buildings being constructed. But then I also see 5-6 story buildings. Also I've heard of terms like "5 over 2" or "6 over 2" or "mass timber" but don't understand how it all works.

Sorry if this is all a bit confusing. Having difficulty articulating this and would love it if someone could suggest me reading/ a guide to understanding how it all works. Specifically I am in the Washington D.C. metropolitan region if that helps.
Hey fellow urbanism and walkability enthusiasts,

Do you have any advice for someone that lives in a non-transit friendly area for improving things? I’m originally from the eastern suburbs of Dallas and just moved back to the DFW area after 12 years away, during which I lived in some super walkable, public transit-robust places including New York and London. Being back in such a car-dependent city is really killing my soul. Life just feels a lot more sterilized and the only reason I’m back is because my parents are getting old. While there are nexuses of density, overall Dallas/Fort Worth is mostly a giant suburb full of highways and strip malls so that’s been mentally tough to deal with.

Fort Worth recently built a Swiss train called Texrail going from downtown to DFW airport with several stops and Dallas’ DART light rail is expanding, but it’s such a geographically huge area that it’s hard for me to ever envision DFW becoming public transportation-friendly. A lot of people who take the trains literally drive to the train station and park their car there. I kind of want to get involved in transit activism but am unsure of how to start.

This morning I posted AI-generated images of a walkable Fort Worth in that subreddit and was downvoted heavily, and the comments revolved on how unrealistic it is and traffic concerns. I also very politely mentioned that DFW is mostly suburban sprawl and not a particularly unique destination, and I was told to stop "dissing the city" and "soften my language." I mentioned that because I'm from here and now that I'm back I want to make it a unique place full of life and vibrancy...but the reality is that DFW simply is not, and a lot of that can be attributed to its sprawl; DFW is as generic as it gets. I don't think that's a disrespectful thing to say, especially as a native. Of course Reddit is Reddit but if that's any indication, it seems like people from the area don't even want change.

Are things as hopeless as they seem? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you!
I’m looking to move. My husband just retired, my kids are still too young for school, and I work remotely. Our relatives are all over the country, and not local to us. Is there a city in the US that I’m just not noticing where we could walk to most things, have 3 bedrooms for - let’s say - under $1M, and not worry about stray bullets or serious safety concerns? Reasonably okay schools would be lovely although as long as there aren’t reasons to worry about physical safety I’m fine with catching them up academically at home. 

I’m getting really disillusioned with finding a place that has any kind of walkability/transit options, is somewhat safe and affordable, and has any kind of unique character or culture. I grew up in multiple European countries and didn’t get to explore the US until I was a bit older and thought I’d find more “urban planning friendly” options. It feels like if you overlay anything remotely walkable with a crime map, the dark red areas are the only ones that are walkable. 

I guess there is New York and SF, but we might be in the wrong income bracket for those places.
Instead of US cities completely tearing down highway overpasses running through the city, would it be better in some cases to convert some of them into rail, bus, and pedestrian only overpasses? I'm just an average layperson; sorry if it sounds ignorant but I'm curious.
For context, I am a casual consumer of urbanist and urban planning content. I've been hooked on it for years now! 

I think a lingering question for me is what are practical policy ways we can improve our cities? I know about things like increasing density across the board, multifamily units in housing, and a couple other issues, but I am curious about what y'all care about!

Let me know what your biggest policy wants are, and why!!
Wanting to know who here works for either an MPO or a regional planning council/agency. What is your experience working there? Can you compare it with working other places? Is it better or worse?


There's a 4 lane arterial road (3.5m per lane) that has poor sidewalks, so one lane in each direction will be halved so only motorcycles fit. The remaining space will be for putting bike lanes and expanding the sidewalk. 1 lane will be a concern since emergency vehicles can't overtake, but with 1.5 lanes, cars can pull over at the half-lane. Is this practical?
Good afternoon all!

My agency is exploring additional advertisement opportunities to help draw in more candidates for currently vacant Supervising Planner and Land Use Technician positions.

Our agency utilizes a wide variety of advertising methods but have been underwhelmed by the amount of candidates we are attracting. 

Anyone have any suggestions of where a good place to advertise would be for individuals experienced in this field? Journals, magazines, websites, we're exploring all options!

Positions are located throughout the County of San Bernardino. Thanks!
Can someone help me better understand the AICP Candidate Pilot program. I’ve mentioned/asked about it at school but all of my professors tell me I still have to wait till I graduate and start working to apply for it (I work as a Planner for my home-state DOT, and will graduate undergrad next Friday, May 5 🥳)

My understanding when I go to the website is that its meant for students to sit for the exam and then work towards their professional experience (similar to how the PE runs in Engineering). I go on the website and it had an easy ti understand graphic but then when I try and get information on how to register to do it it take me to the regular credential requirements which I don’t meet yet. 

Has anyone done this that can help me out? I’m not planning on sitting for it till sometime next year toward the end of my masters program (I’m in a dual bachelors/masters program, which allowed me to start my masters and use those credits towards my Bachelors electives credits which lets me finish my masters in 15 months). I’ve always been told it’s easier to take test like these while still in the school mindset and especially when all the “formal planning” information is still fresh in your head from school and not 5-10-15 years later. I am especially drawn to it since my masters program has specific classes to prep students for the AICP so I want to take advantage of that.






I'm a planner by trade, but I'm also the parent of a school-aged kid. We're NYC expats who live in the burbs now. As we did in the city, we walk the kid to school every morning, as our community has a [decent (though underutilized) sidewalk grid](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/113xu7m/what_do_we_call_places_that_have_the/). My school district has a number of existing school buildings that are end of life (1950s/60s builds) that need either extensive renovation, rehab, and expansion, or demolition and replacement. Our district has gone with the latter option and are closing three neighborhood K-8 schools housing a combined 1000+ students and are in design development for a consolidated school campus way out at the edge of town, on a large lot assemblage with vacant land that they already own.

The district held a statutory public meeting/open house to explain the project recently, with renderings, floor plans, and a site plan, the works. At the meeting, I ask questions to district staff and to the design team as to why this exurban site had to be chosen in lieu of a walkable in-town site, and I'm told that state department of ed requirements have an incentive matrix that favor consolidated school campuses on large lots, and that had the district gone with an in-town site or multiple, smaller in-town sites, they'd receive just a fraction of the state aid that the large-lot exurban site would provide, forcing a property tax increase on residents that would be unpalatable to say the least. Staff also offered several data points showing that the rate of walk-only children at the school has been declining ever since early 2020 - in other words, that the walk to school commuting cohort never bounced back after lockdown and remote schooling, and that many of the parents who used to walk with their kids began driving them once in-person school resumed. They said that was another factor that played in favor of the exurban site selection; *the parents who could be voting with their feet and walking their kids aren't doing it.*

I don't have anything to share, just that it feels like a policy failure on some level, but also a failure of the culture to prioritize and facilitate this travel mode, if that makes sense? Sure, from a DEI perspective, I can also see the value of getting kids from all of the neighborhoods into one site, but I'd also hoped to inculcate my own kid into the value of living and traveling within a place that's walkable and human scaled, and now I'm left eating a shit sandwich.

Anyway, [none of this is that unique](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/4/9/my-disingenuous-push-to-save-a-neighborhood-school), this is America, after all. 

u/clmarohn \- sending up the batsignal for your help. 
Interviewing for an entry-level planning position. Haven’t worked in the private planning sector before and curious what questions to expect that might differ from the typical public sector questions. Would also appreciate any suggestions for questions to ask at the end. Thank you!

I’m looking to immigrate to another country to further my studies in Urban planning. (A major in Climate change/Environmental Studies or Sustainability Studies.-not decided yet) So far, my little research has pointed out Canada, The Netherlands and USA as good countries to study and possibly find a job. I would like some intel on this from those successfully practicing the profession. What would any of you advice about the 3 countries and job availability?


is there a specific "urbanism" name to describe a built decorative feature commissioned by the Stage/City?   
Specifically, I want to know how to describe the famous "Trees of Life" all over Managua, Nicaragua.
What makes more sense for a city looking to invest in low-cost public transit?
“Preferred qualifications” (not minimum qualifications) included masters degree. And from LinkedIn majority of current employees seem to have a masters. In your experience would design experience be valued instead of a masters?

I am a citizen trying to advocate for my municipality to make its affordable housing more equitable.  I have a draft public comment which is about the fact that dense, multifamily buildings constructed in the downtown have affordable units requirements, but suburban sprawl type SFH developments do not.  I am curious about a technical point: is a development on the site of a former golf course considered a "greenfield" development?


According to [these](http://www.publicpurpose.com/pp57-density.htm) [two](http://www.americandreamcoalition.org/landuse/denseair.pdf) articles by the infamous suburbanist Wendell Cox, cities outside the US and other car dependent nations have more congestion because they have a greater number of vehicle miles or kilometres travelled per square mile or kilometre. He also uses the metric of vehicle hours spent per square mile or kilometre to gauge the commuter delays due to congestion. His implication being that higher VKT/km^(2) and higher vehicle hours/km^(2) means more time spent in traffic delays due to congestion. This is also implied to lead to more air pollution because there are more pollutants emitted per distance, even if the cars in question travel shorter distances. This is because slower cars burn more fuel per distance than faster cars, which leads to more emissions per distance. 

Asides from the fact that vehicle hours/km^(2) is a metric that does not account for the impact density on travel times as it does not account for the hours spent commuting per capita, how valid is the metric of VKT/km^(2) as a measurement of congestion?
So I’m on my city’s transportation commission and we’re looking at some CIPs for road widenings at intersections rather than mid block. I want to oppose these. One of my fellow commissioners is also against road widenings but not at intersections. He’s convinced that it’s an effective relief to traffic congestion. I don’t buy it. What do you make of that? How might you respond to that?

NYC has these buildings colloquially known as "Fedders Houses", which tend to be cheaply made as possible and are ugly as sin. Plus they mostly have front driveways, turning the sidewalk into a long active driveaway. These have been very commonly built in low to mid income areas in NYC since the 90s.

They are on the left of this image. Across the street is a pre war (probably 1920s) Tudor style building, and the difference in beauty is night and day.
This is not an America bad post. I find myself in here often trying to debunk comments or threads that such and such doesn't work or people don't like it.

Most recently someone told me bus lines with 10 minute intervals at any part of the day CANNOT work. I have several of those lines around my neighborhood which I use every single day. I live in a neighborhood with almost only single family detached housing.

Today I received a bit of pushback about smaller grocery stores embedded in neighborhoods through groundfloor midrise space or smaller lots. As if it's not workable or acceptable. But that is the ONLY option we have here and it's fantastic.

I often see confused arguments about the viability of public transportation vs car network attrition. A lot of absolutist handwringing. And again, apart from the most remote neighborhoods, we have reliable public transport options WHILE families that prefer cars have that option and are not priced out by toll rings and the like.

There are so many things in American planning that just don't make sense. Minimum buffer yards for apartment buildings which invariably lead to these lawns that nobody uses for anything other than dog poop. And apartment complexes which most of the time seem to demand three times the acreage for parking vs ground floor living space.

I don't think American planners are idiots. I was educated there at first and probably would have thought similar things. But after my bachelor's I moved to Norway and completed my masters in planning. When I go back home to the US I am always thrown off by how inconvenient doing every little thing is. Last time I went for Christmas I was marooned at the house with no cars and therefore no way to even get to a park. I couldn't walk to get food, go to the gym, or get a coffee. I found a coffee place with  17min walk and tried it out but had to frequently walk on the road, squeeze past bushes, etc etc all while probably looking like some cracked out hobo because who WALKS in America? I gave up on that idea and stayed at moms house for several more hours.

I find there's no excuse for it. You can't tell me that the road network is our destiny or that American people will NIMBY everything forever. I just don't buy it. It's like there's just no will to push for good cities in most places.

I say this because when I'm on this sub I very frequently read these takes about how things which I started taking for granted over here are just "not possible." Things that by now, after living here for 6 years, seem incredibly obvious.

Does it have to be that way? Is it a matter of not getting to experience living in non-American cities that get people stuck into some sort of cognitive bias that they're just working with the best they're offered and can't possibly change anything?
In principle, a municipality, county, and state could all have their own zoning board, such that the residents in the municipality would be subject to comply with three different zoning boards.

1. How often is it the case that a place is zoned by more than one level of government?
2. How does this work out (or, how would it work out if it existed)?  Do/would the zoning plans conflict with each other in a way that is overly burdensome/inefficient?

I've heard a variety of different things on my local campus about Modernism with chain stores, but I want to hear from all of you.

How has Modernism in Urban Planning helped or hurt our Urban Areas?
So I get that not everywhere is dense enough to support (or need) a subway, or even an LRT. But how much density do you really need for a solid, frequent bus? (By frequent, let's just say every 15 minutes, so quarter hourly, 6am to midnight seven days a week).

You'd probably need more than 2000 to 3000 people per square km. But do you need more than 6,000 people per square km? Do you need a dense urban area of 10,000+ for just a frequent city bus?

I guess the answer is going to be 'it depends'. But let's just assume a fairly standard route. Passes by some commercial areas, maybe a rail or brt line or two.

Nerdy urban planning recs in nyc? To visit!!
So I watched this great [video by City Beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuHQizveO1c&t=294&ab_channel=CityBeautiful) about the potential of corner stores and I was wondering if you agreed that it could be a solution that cities that are already laid out with euclidean zoning in mind to allow for small pockets of commercial here and there for corner stores and maybe cafes as well? Thoughts?


Has anyone heard of a section of state park being used for development? (U.S.)

There is a large state park near my landlocked hometown that controls access to a major river. If the city wanted to build a marina in that area, would it have any precedent? My thoughts are that they could create a separate advisory commission with at least one member from the DNR sitting on it and a large chunk of the property taxes could go towards the state park. This would increase tourism in the area which would bring more people to the park.
On a recent Political Orphanage episode ([here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/salesmen-beat-at-82081661) starting at \~1:21:30), Jason Voiovich was giving examples how to use salesmanship to appeal to people of different political bents. He made a wonderful argument against single-family zoning in favor of housing density and variety that I hadn't heard phrased this way before. It was his example of appealing to conservatives, but I think it's a great argument generally. 

He explained that single-family housing, far from being family-friendly, undermines its own goals of having a stable, cohesive community. 

A suburb with large expensive houses actually forces people into both constant turnover and also separates families. Imagine a young couple that moves there once they have kids and decent incomes.  Their kids will have to out of the neighborhood when they start working or going to college, because there are no apartments nearby, nor anything to do, so you've immediately put distance between them. And by the time the last kid is moving out, your oldest might be moving back to the neighborhood with their own kids, but you can't stick around to be a grandparent: you don't need a giant house now, you need an apartment that doesn't exist. So now you're separated from your grandkids who live in your old house, and your longtime residency there must come to an end. (They're called granny-flats, ffs.)

Thus, instead of fostering longterm residency by giving people options to stay through their stages of life, single-family zoning makes it uneconomical to stay close to your family, to establish roots in a neighborhood and stay there as a multi-generational family. 

I was already in favor but I had never heard it phrased quite this way before, and it really spoke to me. But I may be biased because I'd love a grandparent around to watch these kids.



My state capital is having an in-person public forum that’s supposed to discuss transit and urban planning, and I plan on going. This would be my first time going to something like this, and I’d like to know what to expect, and to what extent I can participate. 

Also: sorry if you saw the other post on r/transit. I’m just trying to get as many diverse opinions on the matter as possible.
Per Wikipedia:

*“The Sanrizuka Struggle refers to a civil conflict and riots involving the Japanese government and the agricultural community of Sanrizuka, comprising organized opposition by farmers, local residents, and leftist groups to the construction of Narita International Airport (then New Tokyo International Airport). The struggle stemmed from the government's decision to construct the airport in Sanrizuka without the involvement or consent of most area residents.”*

I was wondering if anyone here could offer some more insight about this event, because opposition to the construction of necessary infrastructure such as airports usually sets off my NIMBY alarm. But on the other hand, what the Japanese government was attempting here was much more extreme than just building a few townhouses, and the profound levels of civil resistance exhibited by the protestors is really unheard of.

Can anyone shed some light on this event? Just curious.
Hi,  I've been lurking in the urbanplanning subreddit for a while and found such fascinating content here.  In the interest of developing my knowledge of this field as an amateur, I've selected Order without Design for my public book club to be discussed in two parts: the first half on May 9th and the second half on June 20th.  Would love to have some actual urban planners join for their perspective!  Here's the link: [https://www.meetup.com/books-to-change-your-life-nyc-book-club/events/291879838/](https://www.meetup.com/books-to-change-your-life-nyc-book-club/events/291879838/)  (Posted with permission from the mods)
Here in Bogota we have this huge debate about building a subway or an elevated metro system. There are good arguments on both sides, especially talking about efficiency, costs, and building times. However it seems like nobody is talking about the user experience, what actually implies to have one or another.

For me, even though subways are generally more efficient, it seems terrible to have to spend a couple daily hours underground. Subways are usually poorly lit, have bad ventilation, smell funny and are loud. They are like perfect incubators for illness, both physical and mental. In Bogota it also rains a lot, so subway stations are very likely to get flooded and keep an humid and cold environment. 

The space that is liberated at the surface is usually reserved for car infraestructure, which isn't that good. I think the citizens should have nice views, sunlight and fresh air while commuting, but I'm not sure. Am I being dramatic? What do you think?

and I mean like tokyo as in narrow streets, dense buildings, metro system and things to do.

Here's a link to [a piece on LA's Outdoor Dining rules](https://www.kcrw.com/news/shows/greater-la/outdoor-dining/al-fresco-rules).

TLDR: Outdoor dining was eased in response to the pandemic to help save restaurants. It's being rolled back. 

I'm not sure where I weigh in on it...

Any thoughts?
Im an incoming college freshman and considering economics vs urban planning. I find urban planning more interesting but I'm concerned I haven't seen any websites reporting urban planners breaking 120k.


What is the best way to achieve transit oriented suburbs?

People say streetcar suburbs with lots of missing middle, but almost every example of a streetcar suburb neighborhood that also has significant access to detached housing has pretty low densities. I mean, they're certainly more compact than suburbs today, and more walkable. But they're not really all that dense.
Hi. Here in Bogota we have "Transmilenio", a BTR system of large busses with dedicated lanes and stations. This is a cheap, fast and effective solution for most cities (Bogota however really needs a metro system). There are lots of people that hate it and would prefer a tram system. We had trams in the 40's and then trolleybusses in the 80's, but they didn't work too well. I know that trams are more energy efficient and don't rely of fossil fuels, but in my experience there are also slower and harder to expand. Is there any game changer that the trams have that I'm not seeing?
Small step by a small city, but still and important and inspiring development


I am relatively new to the profession with my first main job in the public sector doing public involvement. I have a master's of urban planning. I was hired at 54k. The minimum wage in my area for a planner 1 is over 58k. The cola is supposed to make up the difference, but im still being paid the minimum of the pay scale. 

Should i not be bothered by this? Should i not be bothered that people hired after me are making more than i am? People without masters degrees? It just feels discouraging...

Also, should they not include my year of internships as experience in the field? 

Thanks for advice.



Apologies if this has been discussed before, but lately I’ve been wondering, is it actually worth one’s time to apply to major national and global planning consulting firms like AECOM, Kimley-Horn, WSP, HNTB, etc.?

I ask because they seem like interesting jobs, and I’ve applied to these types of companies many times. I meet or exceed the minimum qualifications on paper, and yet I never seem to land an interview. The best I’ve gotten on occasion is an email from a recruiter asking me to answer some additional questions in writing, which I do promptly, and then the next thing I hear back is a rejection letter. 

On the other hand, applying for jobs with smaller firms and local governments seems to get me better results.

I’m wondering if others have had this experience. Maybe I’m just not as qualified as I think? Or maybe the job postings are just a formality and they already know who they’re going to hire? Or perhaps the jobs attract so many applicants that one’s individual chance of getting an interview is just really low? Maybe all of the above?

This is specifically for US-based jobs, btw.
What is the difference between a Planner 1 and a Planner 2?  Is there a Planner 3?
What do you use when you have multiple projects that could all take 6 months to a year to complete, to track them. I'm currently working on 4 comprehensive plans with a 5th on the way and I want to stay really organized. I know I could make something quick in Google docs but I didn't know if people might use Excel or something else? Thanks for the help!
I have an assignment for a research methods class and I'd like to try to find data showing the effects on social equity for form-based code vs Euclidian zoning.  Or at least the differences in social equity for cities the get rid of single family zoning.  Does anyone have any advice on good metrics to look at or any good publicly available data sources?  Also, which cities should I compare?  I am trying to keep the scope of my project relatively small and manageable, but narrowing that down is that hard part.  The other problem I am running into is that cities that say they have FBC don't really have FBC.  On the list the cities I have are:

Denver, Miami, Cincinnati, and Grand Rapids for FBC.  Then I was going to compare cost of living/cost of housing in cities of a similar size, controlling for race demographic and political makeup that do not have FBC.  Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated!
So I may have made a mistake. I signed up to take the AICP exam on May 15th, leaving me only 3 weeks to study. I was waiting on confirmation from my employer that they would pay for the exam and may have severely underestimated the time requirements to study. Is this crazy or possible? Should I reschedule for the Fall?

With goals including attracting small businesses and revitalizing blighted houses, what are some of the best ways a small city can use $7 million?

I have roughly 2.5-3 years of professional experience in Planning, with almost 1.5 years of that as an Urban Planner. Have my MUP. Located in a larger Midwest city. 

Currently a City/Community Planner with a nonprofit consulting firm in US. I cannot wait to get out. I'm trying to pivot my career into Natural Resources, Conservation, Environmental/Ecology-related Planning. I have had difficulty finding a way into this sector and it may have to do with where I live.. But most of the environmental planning jobs I see require a lot of experience I don't have yet.

 I look at fed jobs constantly. EPA is doing quite a few rounds of hiring around me, but I'm not interested in administering grants. I need *out* of the office and away from a desk. If I could have it my way, 25% of my work every week would not be at a desk.  

Any ideas on where to start? Thanks!

Edit: wanted to add any planner that has made a transition (or fell into it naturally!) into natural resources, sustainability, conservation, etc, I would love to have a virtual coffee and learn more about how you got to where you are.
Thinking of joining a local transit authority, and would like to hear some of the different day to day experiences in this field. I have a IT/GIS and public safety background, so this field would be a big change for me. 

What are some difficulties on the job? Daily frustrations? 

What skills are most needed to thrive in this field? 

I assume this field requires excellent social skills and assertiveness?
Let's say you won a contest and a normal small American city (around 150k pop.) names you planning dictator for a day. Any changes you make will be honored for the next 10 years at least. What policies would you enact to make the city how you'd like it within practical and fiscal reason?
Please read post as the title might be misleading (I'm not gonna ask the N-th question about 'doesn't density mean more crime?').

One concern people have with higher density living is families with school aged children. The main reason families move to suburbs is to have big yards for kids to play in, because it's often unsafe due to kidnappings and such for kids to walk to the park alone.

As someone who is relatively young (Gen Z), I don't remember a time when it wasn't stigmatized and illegal to have children go play outside on their own.

So, if there is going to be a shift to living in smaller houses with smaller yards, and multi family homes that either come with no yard or very small, often shared yards, how are kids going to be able to play outside?

I've heard that 'natural surveillance' is often quite effective, and of course is you have a walkable area with plenty of people out, I can see how that contributes to (real or perceived) safety, but I can't imagine it's so significant that most/all parents would be comfortable letting seven year olds go out alone. If I had children, I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with that.
So there’s a [4-lane road near me](https://goo.gl/maps/XB94pEx61vJrPNT19) that is extremely dangerous to use for all types of transportation. It is one of the main thoroughfares connecting the Ohio State campus with the off-campus housing neighborhoods north of campus. As a result, it has a very high level of pedestrian, cyclist, and car travel every day. 


The problems with it include:
* Usually the right lanes are used as parking. However, since they’re also traffic lanes and not dedicated parking lanes, people use them to pass sometimes
* The road is wide so speeding is common
* When turning onto the road from side streets, there is extremely low visibility due to parked cars
* Cars getting sideswiped by people drunk driving or speeding is extremely common
* Bike and even skateboard traffic is very high, but this is dangerous due to high car speeds


The main issue with this road is that, although reducing it to two lanes with dedicated parking lanes would be feasible given its traffic volume, the city would never allow it because during Ohio State football games, the parking lanes are vacated and all four lanes are used and crucial for getting gameday traffic in and out of campus. 


Long story short, I’m trying to come up with a solution for this, and I was wondering if any type of temporary curb-bump-outs have ever been implemented before - In other words, it would act as a traffic calmer by reducing traffic to two lanes plus two parking lanes with bumpouts at intersections. But importantly, these bump-outs would need to be removed on gamedays to appease the city’s concerns about football traffic. I know simply painting the lanes is an option but I don’t think that would actually do much. Does anyone have any suggestions for this?
Hello there,

I'm moving out of my career in real estate advisory and valuation into a corporate facility planning position with my old city. My role involves managing facility planning projects and creating portfolio and project plans. I would love any tips, resources and tools I can prepare and better myself in to succeed in this role from planners active in this field.




I ran into this video through the ITE forums and wanted to share. The video does a good job of explaining the desirable features of a protected intersection and showing it in a non-European setting.

High rises can be liveable, often come with better sound proofing (not saying this is inherent, nor universal to high rises), more accessible than walk up apartments or townhouses, increase housing supply and can pull up average density more than mid rises or missing middle.

People say they're ugly or cast shadows. To this I say, it all depends. I'll put images in the comments of high rises I think have been integrated very well into a mostly low rise neighborhood.

Not every high rise is a 'luxury sky scraper'. Modest 13-20 story buildings are high rises too.
**Note: TL;DR available at the end**

Hi! I've encountered [this article](https://cyclingsavvy.org/2020/07/motorist-caused-bike-crashes/) on a Metroplan Orlando study by Cyclingsavvy that aim to study how safe are different types of cycling. They primarily focus on road lane edge, bike lane and sidewalk cycling and seem to consistently find that sidewalk cycling is the safest, followed by bike lane cycling and then road cycling. Safety is measured in car-bike collisions per mile cycled.

However, they also note that drive out collisions at intersections and driveways are more common among sidewalk cyclists than bike lane and road cyclists, and vice versa for right and left hook collisions. From this, the articles infer that it is unlikely that it's because drivers are more likely to yield to cyclists on the sidewalk or bike lanes, as what plausible mechanism exists for drivers to be more likely to yield to sidewalk cyclists during turning maneuvers, while being less likely to do so while going straight through the sidewalk?

Thus the reason inferred by the study is that it is most likely because sidewalk and bike lane cyclists ride slower than road cyclists, as they do according to the data. This gives them more time to react to conflicts due to reduced stopping distances. The fact that bike lanes and sidewalks are located towards the passenger side of drivers also gives both cyclists and drivers more time to react as well, as the driver has to take longer to cross the cyclist's path. This is also why drive out collisions are the most likely, as the driver has to travel less of a distance to come into conflict with the path of the cyclist. 

They also did a comparison with sidepaths, which are shared paths next to major arterials and highways [according to Cyclingsavvy.](https://cyclingsavvy.org/2020/07/safety-on-shared-use-paths-part-2/) They found that there's a lower crash rate on low conflict sidepaths with low intersection counts than high conflict sidepaths with high intersection counts. The latter also has a higher crash rate than sidewalks as well, likely because sidepath riders cycle faster than sidewalk riders as the data shows. 

The conclusion drawn suggests that if you're a fast cyclist, you're better off cycling on the road using vehicular cycling principles as in theory, it will eliminate right hook risks, offer more options for dealing with left hooks, while giving drivers more time and room to react to avoid drive out collisions. 

[This article gives a summary of the methodology](https://cyclingsavvy.org//2020/07/bike-lane-sidewalk-roadway-safety/), and links to some critiques of the 2011 Montreal bike lane study by Lusk and Furth. How was Lusk and Furth received by academia? Let me know.

TL;DR: while the design of the infrastructure plays a role by placing the cyclist further away from turning traffic, sidewalk cycling is safer than road lane edge and bike lane cycling because sidewalk cyclists ride slower, which gives them more time to react to conflicts.
What are some examples of Mid or Small sized Cities with infrastructure that punches well above its weight? 

Should City planners in smaller or mid-sized cities think more large scale when it comes to urban development and infrastructure?


Would a design where drivers turning left must yield to through bound buses work? I imagine drivers might fail to shoulder check and yield, causing crashes.

This design is probably ideal from a transit priority perspective, but not so idea from a safety perspective. I'm not sure whether it's inherent to the design though, or just a matter of driver education.

Hello, before I go into detail I wanna clarify that i don't understand much about urban planning and therefore I am more than willing to listen to other peoples opinions.

I really love cars and I especially love driving. I see now, more than ever, people talking about how they hate that everything is made for cars or whatever. I've even seen people genuinely rallying behind a future with zero cars and it seems like most of the forward thinking urban designers try to get cars out of the equasion as much as possible, especially here in europe.

My question is, is there a future for someone like me, that really like driving? I mean, it's so awsome, I get my own space, I can smoke in my car if I want to, listen to my music on the speakers as I'm driving... My car is almost like a part of me (sounds weird, I know), like, it's a small part, or representation of my personality and individuality. I love drift culture, old classics, car culture in general... will it all kinda disappear because of people like you? (not meant in a derogatory way, it's just that people that love urban design usually hate car centric things)

Sorry for any bad spelling, english is not my first language. Thank you.

EDIT: Thank you all for posting your personal knowledge and insights, I feel like I am coming out of this more well informed. Thank you also for sharing the video from the channel "not just bikes" about amsterdam, I have never been there, the street design and public transport there, from what i saw, is much much better than in portugal, and seems to actually help drivers. 

Remember that every european country is different, I've heard americans talk about europe as if it's one country when the reality is that your life will be very different even between neighboring countries.



Singapore is often described to have excellent public transport, but car-centric infrastructure.

As it turns out, when it comes to streets within our neighbourhoods, it really wasn’t always like this. Despite the car-lite message, we are actually rapidly regressing towards a car-heavy future. Disregarding traffic-calming Silver Zones, those built today would allocate significantly more land to move motor traffic faster, than those built as recent as 10 years ago!

So I did some research on how our engineering standards have evolved, comparing and contrasting typical street designs in Singapore between the 1980s and the 2010s. You can watch the video I linked here, but TLDR, pedestrians are getting an increasingly hostile treatment due to:

• Changing town designs causing boring streetscapes with service roads next to sidewalks
• Wider carriageways with a minimum of 4-lanes as 2-lane streets go practically extinct
• Larger turning radiuses of street alignments and the use of slip lanes at all intersections
• Bigger intersections with more turning lanes which are wider and longer as well
The way people consume urbanist media online and the general discourse that spawns from it seems like it can be pretty unhealthy at times.

The classic example here I guess is folks who have a disdain for NIMBYism pivoting to full YIMBYs, specifically ones with *no* bars held-- basically wishing for some sort of unregulated hypercapitalist hellhole that would stray away from human-centric development.

One more worrying trend from pop urbanist outlets that I've noticed occasionally is the botched, or at least non-comprehensive explanation of suburban and exurban sprawl. A lot of people that consume this content come out of it with the monkey-brained idea that "high-density good / low-density bad" with zero nuanced attached. They do not make any space for rural. Contemporary rhetoric in rural academia realizes the interdependent relationship between rural and urban. Rural cannot be relegated to resource extraction and processing alone. There will always be a demand to live away from people, and rural livelihoods and realities are just as important as those in city cores.

I have seen planners online, even here, casually refer to rural people as "parasites." If that's not poison I don't know what is. Rurality is unique. Its worth should not be measured using the exact same tools we use to evaluate urban. Rurality is not homogenous, either, so the approach we use will naturally vary from place to place. We as planners and urbanists (or perhaps ruralists) alike need to advocate for and help facilitate sustainable rural futures.
I can always remember seeing pictures of areas like [this](https://upload.travelawaits.com/ta/uploads/2021/04/oia-village-in-greece83f98d-800x800.jpg) in Greece, [the Hutong areas of Beijing,](https://www.bordersofadventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Street-view-Hutong-in-Beijing.jpg) and [the favelas of Brazil](https://previews.123rf.com/images/rpbmedia/rpbmedia1802/rpbmedia180200759/96187396-de-janeiro-june-21-2017-streets-of-the-favela-of-santa-marta-in-de-janeiro-brazil.jpg) with a high density of buildings, roads scaled down to human size, a more prevalent sense of verticality, and a fluid mixture of residences with non-residential buildings. When I first saw a favela, I noticed the poverty and crime but I was also instantly drawn to the way everything connects. The small scale winding streets and alleys, the stairways and ramps leading to upper levels, it's very labyrinthine in my opinion. These places are the ones I've always been most interested in walking through and exploring, but I can't really explain why. When I tried to look further into the things that tie these places together, I came to a dead end in terms of urban area classifications and it's very frustrating because I'd love to learn about other similar neighborhoods/villages/towns/cities across the world. Is there a name for this type of human-scale, interconnected labyrinthine development? Are they simply the result of individuals in the area building without specific direction or regulation? And why is this style typically found in lower income areas?  


Thank you for reading and I appreciate all who take the time to provide more information.
I dont know if this has been asked before(I am sorry if it was) but I'd like to ask you guys since you're all more familiar with this issue.

My question is: When a community tries really hard to make the community much nicer(Thanks to our planners who also live there), livable for themselves and children despite the slow process(Since they dont have the necessary resources to speed things up but, you know, little by little is progress at the end of the day.) this is a community with bad infrastructure btw, so locals struggle but they work hard to make the place alittle better. 

I always read how there homes get more expensive, ***after*** they've all collectively worked into making it(small city) nicer for themselves and each other(the locals) so no more bad infrastructure, sidewalks, things that makes life for local families and youth alike, much better. Who in that community or county is responsible for telling these same folks that "This whole place looks nice, good job everyone. However, you will have to pay more just to live here now"? 

Is it the mayor? just asking since I just wanna know!


I've noticed cities up north dumping what seem like very excessive quantities of salt (white dust clouds everywhere-tier) on the roads and sidewalks to melt ice. Can't imagine it's good for the soil, water and wildlife, and things rust very rapidly compared to other parts of the country that don't salt the roads during winter. 

Are there approaches cities around the globe have successfully taken to remove ice in a less destructive fashion?

Hello all,

This is a bit of a flyer, but perhaps it will interest someone here.

I'm an American city planner in the great State of Oregon.  I am lucky enough to be able to spend a few weeks in  London and Cambridge soon.  Out of professional curiosity (aka, I'm a giant nerd), I'd really like to learn more about how city planning works in England.  

Most books I've found are theoretical and I'm more interested in the nuts and bolts of development.   Cambridge is around the same size as my community, so I've been digging around the Cambridgeshire planning website, but I think I lack enough context for it to be of much use.  

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated!  

If anyone has some comparative experiences to share, I'd be curious to hear them too!

Cheers

I live on a non standard corner, meaning its not a 90 degree corner, and my house faces the corner, not one side. I am planning on building a pool in my backyard and found out that my huge backyard is technically zoned a side yard. And the regulations state that I cant build the pool where I want due to a 30 foot setback from my front yard property line. My property is randomly not the sidewalk either. Its randomly 17 feet from the corner of my garage to the middle of my front/side yard. So my property line is like 8 feet on my side front yard away from my backyard fence. So then into my backyard, I cant build for  22 more feet. Why? My side is facing a street. Theres about 10 feet of grass next to the street, then sidewalk, then 8 feet to the property line, then 8 feet to my fence, then 22 feet to where I can build. What is the legal reason there needs to be so much space where nothing is built?
Came across this video that says that induced demand is a myth:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOYLiTj4vag

Is there a consensus on the science on induced demand? While it makes sense that building more highways doesn't necessarily help if the bottleneck is somewhere else such as an off-ramp. But I'm curious if induced demand is a myth even in cases where additional roads are built in a appropriate manner i.e debottlenecking.



I usually see Amsterdam (and the Netherlands in general) praised for having the best cities in terms of urban planning, so I started asking myself if Amsterdam has reached the peak for a well planned city in our time and age or if there are still aspects to improve, be it Amsterdam itself or other cities that could surpass the standard it has set. 

I assume that to an extent this can be quite relative as different planners will have different ideas; but I'm not one myself, so I want to hear from the experts.
The city is planning to "improve the accessibility of the roundabout", it has an underground pedestrian pass and while putting lifts there is a good idea, they want to add a bike lane on the surface.  


In the present the roundabout has 3 lanes and tram tracks going straight through it, they divert there so the tram can make a turn too. The place is very crowded, the drivers are speeding because of it. It's difficult to merge too, everyone is very aggressive in the way they drive. It'd be a disaster to place an unprotected bike lane, as it's presented in the plans. The bike lane is pointless anyway because there's no bike roads leading to the roundabout. The lane would start a 100m before the roundabout, go through it and abruptly end 100m after it. It's so stupid and incredibly dangerous, the place is very accident prone even now.  


They want to ask the citizens about their opinion on this project. What could I write to them? I doubt they'll listen because they ignored the opinions about the previous project (they removed a bridge for crossing over a busy road despite the citizens being against it) but I feel I have to try to do something. I think I'll link and shortly describe a few research papers about unprotected lane injuries but I should suggest something else in turn, right? Although I doubt anything good for bikes can be done there since that place is far away from any bike roads on the pavement so it'd be isolated anyway.
This might be a very dumb question but I can't find much information on this. For cities that have high housing demand (especially in the US and Canada), why don't the cities profit from this by developing their own land (bought from landowners of course) while simultaneously solving the housing crisis? What I mean by this is that -- since developing land makes money, why don't cities themselves become developers (for example Singapore)? Wouldn't this increase city governments' revenue (or at least break even instead of the common perception that cities lose money from building public housing)?
I'm having an incredibly hard time finding summer internships in planning. For context, I'm going to be wrapping up my undergrad in Urban Studies/GIS in May (starting grad school in the fall) and I've been applying for internships in planning/planning-adjacent fields since the end of January. I live in Connecticut so the number of internships, even at COGs/MPOs and town/city govs, are so severely limited that I've started applying for positions 2+ hour commutes away in MA and NY. After filling out dozens of applications I've heard back from two and bombed an interview at our capital region's MPO. 

&#x200B;

So here's my question: To who/where in general can I beg for a summer internship in planning? I've been through the few postings I've been able to find in my area and I've failed miserably so far, so I'm guessing I should just start emailing planning/zoning departments? I'm at a loss and getting pretty demoralized so any input is appreciated. (Also, my University's career development center gave me the thumbs up on my resume/cover letters, so unless they're full of it I doubt that's the issue)
Hi all,

I’m in a masters program creating a site plan and am looking for recommendations for tools to do so. I need to design building footprints/polygons, measure their area, create roads, and visually display this for the instructor/client. Potentially id also like to incorporate zoning information. 

Do you have any recommendations for tools I can use to do this? 

I have access to Esri software through my university, but am a little rusty on GIS. I’ll relearn as I go if it’s the best option. Any recommendations for tools to do this?

Thank you!
Edit: How are trams different from and/or a better option than other forms of public transit/cars? (I messed up my title, my apologies!!) 

I've been discussing this heavily with a couple of people recently and the general consensus from everyone else—other than trams being environmentally friendly and being able to transport more people at once—is that it isn't much different. 

I know trams are significantly better but don't really have any facts to justify my own knowledge. A common argument was the amount of space tram rails take up overground, similar to cars. How does this make it any different? Moreover, how are tram rails more convenient than an underground metro system?
I’m writing a research/ argumentative paper and my argument is about  the issues with suburban sprawl. I also need to cover the other side of the argument that suburban sprawl isn’t that bad. So what are some positives of it?

I've started an open-source project that measures how human-friendly a particular residential area is. For now, this score is calculated using a manual checklist, but the aim is to have this score fully automated for regions that have sufficient data. There are some alternatives already (like the [walk score](https://www.walkscore.com/how-it-works/), but most of these are opaque and you can't suggest improvements.

So what do you think makes a city or residential area liveable? What would you like to have close by and what is your preferred mode of transport? How would a liveable city look like in your opinion?

I've already created an initial [checklist](https://github.com/colin-dumitru/Liveable-Cities-Score/blob/master/checklist/Residential%20Building.md) that you can use to calculate the LCS for your residential area. It's also available in [Excel](https://github.com/colin-dumitru/Liveable-Cities-Score/blob/master/checklist/Residential%20Building.xlsx) form. 

Any feedback in welcomed.
The goal of the interior mall's deconstruction is to "rewild," the site, Wood said, noting a need for the mall to have outdoor spaces and natural elements that are more reflective of Fort Collins. In its preliminary plans, McWhinney hopes to go from 4.2 acres of outdoor space on the edges of the existing mall to 11 acres of open space woven through its new, open-air design.

“Right now, you look at the mall from an aerial (perspective) and it’s like a fortress surrounded by a moat of asphalt parking. There’s very little permeability and very little — beyond that courtyard out there — really no place to gather,” he said.
I need to get city boundaries based on the density of street networks/population/etc. Do you know any open source implementations of similar stuff? I've read articles with the descriptions of these methods but haven't seen the code attached.

Administrative boundaries won't do, because I'm gonna work with Urban Scaling Laws, and these are quite sensitive to the consistency of defined boundaries.

I'd be very grateful if you could help!
This is how some mall in Italy are built, with nearby apartment complexes.

On the left there's a [mall with a big supermarket insid](https://piazzaparadiso.it/)e, some shops some places you can eat something and so on. On the tight there are apartment complexes that also have commercial areas at ground level. For car parking there's an underground parking for both the mall and the apartment complex, but for reasons there are a lot of surface parking nearby. ([photo](https://i.imgur.com/nASVhGD.jpeg)  [other photo](https://i.imgur.com/SwpvEX1.jpeg))

The reasons are that there's nearby a underground metro station that's near to a motorway, so people park their cars to get the metro line to go in Turin if they're coming from areas with bad public transportation, but this is another story.

I thin that building apartment complexes with nearby commercial areas makes sense to make the residential areas more valued, provided of course that the shopping areas are full with thriving shops.

[According to the infamous and divisive John Forester](https://archive.org/details/bicycletransport0000fore/mode/2up), bike lanes allegedly make right & left turn conflicts worse than cycling in the centre of the lane. 

>*Under the normal system the motorist right turn, when properly conducted, starts with a rightward merge, either into a position on the cyclist's normal path of travel or across it into a right-tum-only lane. In the latter case the interaction is completed; the right-turning motorist turns from his lane away from the cyclist. If the motorist turns into the cyclist's path there is further interaction if, as is usual, the motorist slows for the turn. The cyclist slows down also, or, if he prefers and if the way is clear, he merges left and overtakes the motorist...*  
>  
>*Under the bikeway system the motorist right turn is not preceded by a merge. The motorist turns from his traffic lane across the bike lane or sidepath… the motorist must combine the merge and the turn. This requires the motorist to do more than is humanly possible. He must look left and ahead to make sure that no traffic is coming from the cross street, and he must look to his right rear to see if any cyclists are coming. He cannot do both at once, because his eyes cannot swivel in such a wide arc without a movement of the head. Given this choice, naturally the motorist often continues to look for the traffic ahead, which threatens him, rather than for cycle traffic, which is not dangerous to him and which is in any case infrequent.*  
>  
>*The cyclist, moreover, has no chance of avoiding the motorist once the motorist has started to turn... The turning motorist exchanges forward motion for sideward motion, cutting into the cyclist's path and slowing down simultaneously. In many cases the cyclist cannot, after realising* *what is happening, apply sufficient deceleration to prevent himself from running into the side of the car as it turns. Whether the cyclist is in a bike lane or on a sidepath Is immaterial. Although the conditions are different in small details, in neither case has the cyclist much chance to escape, and in order to avail himself of that small chance he must exercise very careful vigilance, have great understanding of traffic behaviour to predict what is happening, and be able to manoeuvre his bike like a racing cyclist.*  
>  
>\- Forester, Bicycle Transportation, 1983, p.136

Very wordy I know right? Well here is the passage on left turns:

>*Car-bike collisions in which the car is turning left typically occur after the car is halfway through its turn. These account for 13% of car-bike collisions in nonbikeway systems. Left turns are of course a factor in a large proportion of car-car collisions, and the mechanism is probably the same for each type. Bikeways offer no protection against this type of collision. Rather they aggravate the causes of such collisions by putting the cyclist where he is less likely to be seen by the left-turning motorist and where his habits are less likely to protect him, and by limiting or preventing the cyclist’s avoidance maneuver. The lack of protection is obvious. Presumably this type of collision occurs because the motorist either does not see the approaching cyclist or underestimates his speed. The best prevention is for the cyclist to ride where he can best be seen, which is as close as possible to the traffic lane and not over to the side of the road or on the sidewalk. This position also gives the cyclist more room for his avoidance maneuver, which is an instant right turn to get away. Bike lanes near the curb give the cyclist less room to turn in, and sidepaths remove all chance of turning at road speed...*  
>  
>*The cyclist's left turn in the normal system is a series of left merges to the centre line or the left turn lane, followed by a left turn when traffic permits...*  
>  
>*The cyclist on a bikeway is in a different situation. He must cross the intersection on his original course and turn left at the far side of the intersecting street. Somewhere along that course he reaches a position at which he must decide whether to turn or not. To reach that decision he must observe traffic from his right, from in front, and from behind, and he has just ceased worrying about traffic from his left... it is beyond human capability to observe all this traffic simultaneously. He will make a mistake.*

>\- Forester, Bicycle Transportation, 1983, p.138-39

Asides from Forester's verbose explanations, how do [Dutch style intersections and roundabouts](https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2014/02/23/junction-design-in-the-netherlands/), as well as [bike boxes](https://nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/intersection-treatments/bike-boxes/), address these issues that Forester brings up? Sorry if this is a bit long of a thread.
3-8 story, attached buildings with no off street parking are peak urbanity in my opinion. This is why the parts of NYC built before World War II are so special, as they're largely made up of these.

All 3 of these are different, but share the aforementioned characteristics.

They are very dense, while still being "human scale" and encouraging people to do things like hang out on the stoop and leave their buildings for amenities.  While not having giant buildings on every block that block sunlight. And it discourages car ownership.

Some other good qualities of these include:

\-Zoned so that amenities are generally within short walking distance

\-Tight streets 

\-Minimal amount of driveways cutting through sidewalks

\-densities in the 50k to 120k PPSM density range, easily rivaling European cities.

-Parks and playgrounds within walking distance

I think high rises have their uses (like CBDs and tower in the park developments in the outskirts), but I believe that midrise is the way to go to for building dense, walkable, neighborhoods with high quality of life.
Here's an idea for phasing in priced on-street parking.

I recognize there can be valid arguments for keeping street parking free, perhaps in certain contexts. This post isn't to debate whether pricing street parking is a good idea. This post is about how to implement it if it's already judged (in whoever's minds) a good idea.

When city governments/planners consider implementing more wide-spread street parking pricing, especially in residential areas, there can be backlash. I imagine the backlash is greater if residents have used on-street parking for longer, if other modes aren't as viable (e.g. infrequent/limited transit), and if the population density is lower ("There's plenty of street parking! Why charge us?"). Despite arguments to the contrary (e.g. this land isn't yours), the reality in democratic societies is that if it is politically popular to keep street parking free, it'll probably remain so.

So here's a proposal. Give each current resident in the city one non-transferable parking permit that allows them to park one vehicle on any city street for free, while following any other posted restrictions (e.g. max 2 hours). Those who don’t have the permit (e.g. new residents, visitors) would be subject to any street parking pricing. Use the revenue to make neighbourhood improvements - e.g. street furniture, street cleaning, more transit, revamped parks.

This could be politically popular (and get passed) since:

* Current residents benefit from this - they can keep using street parking while getting nicer streets and more transit.
* Visitors don't vote.
* New residents constitute a minority at first, so they wouldn't be politically influential. Plus, when people move, they are already disrupting their own status quo, so they may be more mentally prepared for new things like priced street parking.

Over time, long-time residents would decline, and new residents would increase, but priced street parking could remain politically popular since:

* Once new residents establish status quos/routines, they may get used to it. 
* The benefits from the program will increase - e.g. nicer streets, even more transit, nicer parks.
* With nicer streets and more transit, some people may have shifted away from driving, so the population who might support free street parking could decline. 
* Drivers may become used to being able to find parking when they want it instead of having to cruise around, so they may not even want parking to be free again at that point.
* It reduces pressure to increase property taxes and other municipal taxes/fees.

As new residents become the majority, I can even see the city revoking remaining free permits ("Why do they get to park for free?"). But even if not, by the time the last long-time resident stops driving or moves away, priced street parking would have been fully implemented.

As an aside, among other effects, pricing street parking could make it easier to densify cities, since new developments are often objected to out of street parking concerns.

Thoughts?
I was thinking about Land Value Taxes, but I realized that Property Taxes have the ability to scale through property value independent of the levied rates. That led me to wonder whether some cities are overly dependent on this scaling property to keep the city funded in the future. Would a city eventually be at a deficit if the same property didn't appreciate X% every couple of years? If this is an issue, how will Land Value Taxes tackle it?
I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/bx8vvh/next_american_city_to_get_a_subway/) very interesting post from 4 years ago about the next city to get a subway.

I was wondering you guys' take on this question, but with light rails or streetcars.

Good Day,

I’ve noticed that majority of the literature on urban planning leans more towards density as it is more efficient financially and provides a better means for citizens to access both local and private services. One thing that I do not see a lot of research on is the size of housing to accommodate more than one or two people. More specifically, how does a family with two children fit into the density equation if 3 bedroom apartments are so rare and so unaffordable ? 

I feel like families are forced to sprawl because the neighbourhood with density simply do not provide adequately sized affordable housing for families.

I would love to move to a denser/sustainable place but I feel like my family was never considered in the density equation.

Thoughts ?



First time long time –

My town received a grant for a road diet on our main drag. The town manager has slowly been warming up to the idea of bike lanes and traffic-calming measures like raised pedestrian crossings and traffic circles.

However, we need case studies to get this over the hump. Any suggestions on studies of town centers & main streets that have implemented these policies and how local safety and economic activity faired afterwards?

Deets:

– New England, USA  
– 30K total population  
– Suburb of 120K population city  
– Amtrak station with regional rail service 1 block from main street (!)  
– Interstate highway running parallel to the main street 1 mile away  
– 27K jobs in town with 16K working-age citizens, so pretty healthy influx of workers during the day, though mainly in less dense light industrial and office parks away from main street

To give a sense of the current space; it's a traditional New England town green ringed by town hall, town library, post office, a couple banks, and a lot of empty retail space. There is a development project in the works to bring apartments and three new storefronts onto the green at one end, 100 1br units at work-force housing pricing.

The main street is a state road and is currently 4 lanes wide with unusually wide lanes in one direction, as one of them doubles as on-street parking, though this is unmarked. There are lights at either end of the green with another light in the middle for a street that crosses the green.

One of the lights is for an intersection of the main street and the terminus of another state road at an angle to the main street. This intersection is quite large and has been the site of some very serious accidents as cars approach the intersection at pretty high speeds (45+) and have to turn mid-intersection to follow the state road. As you might imagine, crossing this intersection as a pedestrian is unpleasant, to say the least.

Thank you so much in advance!
I’m currently on track to graduate in the next month or so with my bachelors of urban planning. Over the course of the last 5 years, I have found several different planning jobs from private sector to public sector, and from transportation to land development to planning law. Honestly, with every passing year of my studies and every additional internship I’ve taken, I find myself less and less interested in the field of planning. What other careers pathways are appropriate with a bachelors of planning (more specifically a bachelors of environmental studies, honours planning, co-op) a lot of my colleagues are saying that I should still aim to get my RPP sees that I’m graduating from an accredited program through the Canadian Institute of Planners (American Planning Association equivalent). Please send to a soon to be grad!

Note: I am Canadian (don’t know if that’s important)
By far the most complained about noise in US/CAN apartments is impact noise -- the sound created by impacts with the floor. 

I've seen people from US and Canada say that they don't want to live in an apartment because of the noise. I often see some Northern Europeans laughing at them for not being able to tolerate some noise in a city. This is just a hypothesis, but I'd wager that Northern Europeans, with their lower noise tolerance, (when US and Canada people are complaining about noise) are thinking more about outdoor noises wafting in such as cars passing by. 

Most North Americans are not going to be bothered by this kind of noise. Impact noise can be very stressful.

It shouldn't be that having an upstairs neighbor with a 5-year-old will mean that the child jumping, dancing, or running across floor is so strong that it creates very loud banging noise and shakes the ceiling below, but unfortunately that's the case. And since children enjoy playing most of the time, that horrible banging, creaking, and shaking is going to occur a lot.

Even worse, just the sound of an adult male walking across the floor in some US apartments can also create a ton of banging and shaking noise with each footstep. This is a deep reverberation kind of noise that is hard to record to give those unfamiliar with it an idea of what it's like. It's best understood when having lived in the dwelling below.

One of the reasons the sound is so stressful is because of the randomness of it. Someone may be working on something that requires concentration and all of a sudden *BANG* yikes, it seems the neighbor may have dropped something upstairs. My neighbor should be allowed to live their life normally and make mistakes such as dropping things, but why do we tenants have to tolerate this?

Unfortunately people seem to blame their neighbors rather than the developers and landlords who are the real parties responsible for this problem.

Some will respond to this by saying, well demand better building codes. But I'd guess that most people saying that did not have a hand in creating their country's building code, thus not understanding how difficult that would be. Real estate owners have a lot of power in the US and would for sure push back hard against any new codes which cost them money to implement. 

How can we mandate better building codes for impact noise?

Edit: car noise was used as a lazy example but I meant random outdoor noises that aren't extremely intrusive. I don't mean living next to a highway, but rather in a residential area. In the highway case yes it would be stressful. Sorry for the confusion.
So, I get that median oriented bus lanes are often better. But couldn't you address conflict from right turning vehicles?

Curbside bus lanes can be designed such that conflict with right by turning vehicles is eliminated. Eg a solid white line and plastic bollards demarcating where lane changes are illegal, dotted white line and red paint where vehicles may encroach (but this space should be minimized).

Right turning vehicles should be required to turn right from the drive lane, and there should be transit priority signals that turn all traffic movements red while giving the bus a transit signal (with right on red prohibited). Loops located in the ground 100-140m ahead from the light should detect Buses ~10 seconds in advance. Enforce with red light cameras and hefty fines.

You might ask why. On some streets such as the one pictured, there isn't space to put a station in the middle of the street. This way curbside access is retained.
I’m currently in my second year of college, and now is the time to start taking classes for a minor if I want one. I feel geography is super relevant and not my strong suit so I would like to improve. The issue is, it wouldn’t be easy and I’m on course to graduate a year early so it might push my graduation back a semester. Is it worth it?
I’m majoring in Environmental Design. It’s an urban planning bachelor’s degree. Still unsure with whether I want to go for a Master’s degree.

I [watched this documentary](https://www.films.com/ecTitleDetail.aspx?TitleID=111072) for a class and was struck at how this iconic building, which many assume is just for offices, was actually designed from the ground up to be mixed-use. (The building has offices, restaurants, services, [apartments](https://twitter.com/KetuAlbrecht/status/1646296033419206656) on the higher floor.) I haven't really seen such buildings in America - although I've seen them [a lot in East Asia](https://www.kpf.com/story/mixed-use) and particularly South East Asia - so I was wondering what caused the change. The buildings have a good mix of density and livability, while still effectively using the expensive land in downtown cores and stations. It also seems to counteract the often-held idea that vertical high-rises can be like vertical suburbs; residents can get many of their needs within the building itself and create "third places" to meet. It also goes against the idea that such buildings are isolating; residents are also still very much connected to the street, as they can go down the elevator and go outside and interact with the city around them, and the people from the street (i.e. nonresidents) can go inside the building for work, entertainment, etc.


With the recent rise in office-to-residential space, such as the Chicago Tribune project, we've been seeing a change in how high-rises are viewed in America. Lately office conversions are touted as a way to increase the downtown populations of cities and use up otherwise vacant office space. However, these projects are very difficult, as they're both [constructed in completely different ways](https://twitter.com/bobbyfijan/status/1430869036326338564) and can make larger floorplans awkward. In either case, however, it seem to be going from one single use (office) to another (residential), with no vertical mixed-use inside. 


Is this because of structural issues, or because zoning/approval permits for such projects still zone for single-use? How can we encourage more mixed-use within taller buildings? (I'm not saying all buildings have to be super-tall skyscrapers; rather, if we encourage our tall buildings to be mixed-use, it can avoid many of the negatives associated with them.)
Hey all, not sure if this is the best place to ask. The city I work at is looking to revamp its website to make it easier for people to apply for projects online. Can you recommend any city websites that you know of that have a nice front-facing public interface? Any leads greatly appreciated.
So, much of this subreddit is very focused on United States, Canada, and western Europe because much of the content on youtube (Not Just Bikes, CityNerd, Strongtowns, Ohtheurbanity, Citybeautiful, etc. is based there. But I've noticed that we don't hear much about Australian cities, even though it seems like they have unique features and challenges that would be very interesting to learn about.
I admit, I know nearly nothing about sydney, melbourne, brisbane, Perth, Canberra etc and don't know how they are on urbanity, housing, biking, or public transportation?  Are they making strides to be more like europe? Or are they falling behind? Does anyone have any content or articles that can shed light on this?

I have a bachellors degree in urban planning and I'm looking to specialize and work on social issues, specifically (but not limited to) affordable housing in the latino community. (Being a latino myself I am mostly interested in that community, but it could be a little to specific). 

I'm curious to know if there is a master degree that focus on those issues, or a local government or organization that is actively working on the matter in America.



Recently, the transit department in my city, Boston, had a change in leadership. Naturally, an extensive nationwide (and beyond) search was done to select the new director. The new director has experience managing large transit agencies and a track record of implementing positive changes. 

However, he has absolutely no former ties to Boston. He didn’t grow up here nor has he ever lived here—he therefore may not understand how neighborhoods fit together. The local tribal knowledge which he lacks could be useful for a transit agency director. But no one really cares because it’s more important to find someone with the right qualifications and track record.

But when you look at mayor, it’s completely different. Our current mayor moved to greater Boston over 20 years ago to attend Harvard and never left. Over 20 years in Boston, and yet she was attacked during the mayoral campaign for being a transplant from Chicago.

From what I read, it seems like Ann Hidalgo is an excellent mayor (of Paris). Obviously this won’t happen, but I would love for her to be the mayor of Boston once her term in Paris runs out. She has experience governing an even larger city; she has a track record of implementing positive changes (changes that Boston voters say they want). And yet it’s a complete non-starter because for mayor you don’t pick the most qualified candidate in the world, you have to pick someone from your city and preferably they grew up in the city too.

Does anyone else think it’s a little strange how vastly different the residency criterion is for transit director vs mayor?
Do urban planning / design firms ever offer volunteer work for aspiring planners? Or allow students/professionals to shadow planners and learn skills? 

I’m enrolling myself in a one year certificate program for planning before I pursue a master’s full on, and I just want to know how I can get inside experience because my background is in political science - not planning.
Currently interning at an agency I want to work for full time as a planner but I am not in the planning department. The planning department is hiring a full time planner, I applied, but I have not heard anything back yet so I am guessing my lack of actual planning experience is what may be pushing me down the list.

There is an opening for a landscape planner at a nearby city, should I even bother applying? Would that experience help at all? Or should I wait until more planning positions open?
I'll be honest: I am wildly underprepared for a position like this. I have no formal education past a high school diploma and have spent the last 6 years working dead-end retail jobs, but Not Just Bikes sent me down the rabbit hole of urban planning communities a couple years back and I've committed to going for a proper degree and pursuing a career; but I haven't started college yet. I wasn't expecting to even get an interview, but now that I have it scheduled I want to be as well-prepared as possible. Any and all advice is helpful
Has anyone taken a look at their municipality's existing zoning and determined how many dwelling units could be built, just solely based on lot area and density limitations? Trying to tackle this task now in preparation for a massive re-zoning and getting ahead folks complaining that our municipality is already too dense.

Here has been my process: 

Using our GIS, take X zone and determine what the total parcel area is within that zone. Take that number and divide by the allowable density, rinse and repeat.

Obviously this approach does not take into account any other binding constraints like parking, open space, market demand, etc., so whether it is even a relevant statistic is questionable. The goal is that when we get asked how many units this adds that we at least have a figure.

What do you all think? Helpful? Not helpful?
Just something I'm wondering about as a layperson.  Urban planning talk about clogged highways and roadways seems always to go in the direction of talking about "car-dependence" and modifying residential patterns.  The same with the conversation about reducing carbon emissions.  But on a lot of roadways and especially interstates, freight trucking is a large portion of the traffic, and it's also especially punishing on the roads in terms of increasing their need for maintenance and repair.

The freight railways are supposed to provide public benefit as "common carriers" in exchange for their legal monopolies, and there's a strong argument that they don't do enough.  They focus on running fewer, more profitable trains (precision scheduled railroading) rather than volume and convenience for shippers.  

Why not focus more on replacing trucking with freight rail?  This should be more politically palatable than trying to change automobile use, which means messing with citizens' habits and lifestyles.  

Is it possible that politicians don't want to address the issue because they've been captured by industry?
Even if we make all new builds net zero then our already existing houses still have way too high of emissions. We need to change how we view homes in order to solve the issue. One of the big things that the researchers say we need to do is “reach net zero housing construction rates by 2035” which struck me as a fancy way of saying “stop urban sprawl and densify instead.”

Here are some of their proposed Government solutions:

* discourage second home ownership

* Discourage foreign investors from purchasing homes

* Close loopholes so that homes can’t be left vacant when an owner dies (not a normal result but one that still happens)

* Provide incentives for homeowners to downsize after their kids move out

* Consider creating a cap and trade system which charges homeowners extra when their homes are above a specified sq footage per occupant and rewards home owners who are under the specified ratio

I thought the last point especially was interesting since it would effectively give ANOTHER financial incentive for people to help cities densify.

Hi, at the moment I’m an Urban Planner in Italy. I studied and graduated here (plus a master in Barcelona). I graduated both bachelor and master’s degree cum laude. I’m working as a freelance planner from 3 years (helping other planners, not on my own) and I’m a certified urban planner.
I can speak (obviously) Italian and English (I have a B1 certificate, but actually I’m more on a B2/C1 level - need more speaking since I don’t use it often here, but I have no problem in writing, reading and hearing).
My question is, if I’d want to move to the Netherlands, as a non-Dutch speaker with no clue of their urban regulation, could I still find a job in my working sector? 
Has anyone some suggestion? I’d like to hear your experiences.
I am in my last quarter of undergrad and really want to go into urban planning.  I have spent the last few years on the board of a local public transit non-profit and have such a passion for sustainable transportation.  I really want to expand outside my small town and move to a large city with better public transportation and get into planning but it feels like every single "entry level" planning job needs years of experience.  Could really use some advice of how to get out of my small town and into big city planning
Hey, fellow nerds. Long-ass post. I'm currently a grad student, American in Australia at the moment, and wondering if I've made a huge mistake, and need some seasoned advice/input/reality checking.

I've known I wanted to be a transport planning for a hella long time. Years. I graduated undergrad with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from a fairly selective liberal arts institution in the US. It really is true what they say, it served me well, at first the value wasn't super obvious but it became clear I was good at both abstract and applied problem solving, AND seeing the bigger contextual picture and working with people, and this combo gave me success in the workplace (I was working in the tech industry at the time).

Eventually it came time for grad school so I could switch careers and start planning. However after a year of skoole in the US (U of Minnesota), I appreciated the social justice aspect of my grad program but felt there was a lack of technical rigor in terms of transport, and when I took a traffic engineering course, induced demand was not even mentioned ONCE. (I was a bit disillusioned for a few other reasons as well but that's another story.) I took a year off during my undergrad so I decided I'll do that again and withdrew from my program. I don't regret this decision one bit; it ended 7-years of intermittent low-grade depressive episodes and I had two great years of excellent mental health. My sleep was great, social life took a big leap forward, had a fun and challenging fancy restaurant job, living carfree in the city.

I was refining my interests and really would like to work on public transport network development or maybe even HSR network development, and thought hey, maybe this is something that I could work on in Australia. It sure would be fun to go abroad, de-Americanize my thought process and perspectives a bit, and the transport project pipeline in Australia seemed like something I could enjoy  lifetime of interesting work and good work-life balance if I ended up staying and getting PR.

Well now I'm here, got into a very reputable university (Uni Melbourne), scholarship, everything, and man it is fucking me up. Everything is so different than I expected. The planning culture and political structure is bonkers. It seems like the wild west. And the rental market is crazy here, fingers crossed I am not homeless in a few months. Everyone says the first year abroad is hard, and they are right, the culture shock is neverending.  I've never been a worse student, I suspected American grading is inflated but I'm going from As & B's to barely passing, missing deadlines.

I think part of this is that I expected more of my classes to transfer, they gave me credit for 3 of the 9 classes I took in the US (I was reasonably expecting credit for about ~6). So I'm feeling stuck taking classes that seem basically like reruns with similar material and feeling very unmotivated. Write 1000 words about how postmodernist planning is just modernist planning in a trenchcoat? I've already done that!!! And now my degree will take 4 semesters instead of the 3 I was expecting which increases the cost dramatically, and it will take me 5ever to pay this off even if the Biden admin successfully achieves a best-case overhaul of the student loan system.

But most importantly, once again, I feel like I'm not getting the skills-based education I'm seeking. I already know how to think theoretically, and I'm thankful for that, but it seems like the academic side of planning is afraid of the maths/skills/rigor of transport engineering. And I am not afraid! Show me the numbers I wanna get down and dirty and start tinkering! It just seems like it's never gonna happen until I get work experience working with transport models, which I'm afraid I won't get because I am not getting exposed to them in school.

There is a temptation to leave my current program at Uni Melbourne and go to do University of Sydney's Master of Transport. The courses look so much more interesting, skills-based, directly applicable to what I want to do for work. But it would likely involve relocating again, into an even more impossible rental market than Melbourne, and taking on even more cost both in resettling and the program cost.

Please, I need advice. How do I go forward? Will I be able to get the maths-hewvy ridership/demand-modelling jobs I want in AU or the US with a sexy but highly theoretical planning degree? Or how or where do I get the necessary experience if it won't happen at uni? Does it matter at all? If I stay in this course, how do I motivate myself to do all the work even tho my interest in much of it has fallen off dramatically? O great hive mind, I beg you. Any advice is helpful and greatly appreciated.
Hello all! Seeking some career advice. So as the title suggests I currently am not in the planning field. I work in collegiate athletics and knew this would not be a lifelong career. I’ve had my fun and am looking to make the switch to planning which I have had a longtime interest in. I graduated with my bachelor’s in Geography in 2019 along with a certificate in GIS and am currently working on my Masters in Public Administration. I’m feeling quite discouraged as I have no formal planning experience or a degree in the field so I feel like that will be quite a hindrance to making the switch. Does anyone have any advice on how to best market myself for entry level planning jobs? Or am I aiming too high and should try to find internships first to fill the work experience gap? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks!
There's a lot of fear mongering, some of it justified, a lot of it not, over fear of losing private yard space, having to deal with people living above or below you, privacy due to shared space etc that motivate zoning for exclusively single family detached houses.

Assuming these concerns are valid, why don't we at least see more single family attached housing? Like townhouses and row houses? Much denser and more efficient, private yard, private entrance just like a single family house. You can just soundproof the shared walls.
Hi everyone! So I am planning a move across country and have an interview for a planner II position in a permitting office. I have experience as a regional planner for the past 1.5 years. But I have not had much experience with permits and the process that comes with it. The city I am interviewing for is in California where I completed my undergrad in. 

Does anyone have any helpful advice or links that could best help me prepare and hopefully get the position? Thank you!!! (:
Snippet from the article: "The results showed reforms that loosened restrictions were associated with a 0.8 percent increase in housing units at least three years after the reform was implemented. Those same reforms were not associated with any significant effects on rent. On the other hand, policies that increased restrictions on housing development were associated with small increases in rent, according to the paper."
Does anyone know of any applications, systems, solutions etc. for a non programmer to put up a camera, run the video through software, and get a (somewhat reliable) ped/bike count? I know the software exists and it's even up on Github but its uncompiled. Bonus points for systems that conduct counts but never actually save the video files. My town is concerned about privacy issues.

My only options at the moment are to pay exorbitant fees for engineering firms to conduct counts or try and learn enough to compile and debug software, which probably isn't going to happen.
So I was watching [Last Week Tonight and the topic was HOAs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrizmAo17Os), specifically how they are quasi-governmental, but truly contain almost zero oversight from traditional government entities (such as who do you complain to when your HOA is bad). 

It was actually pretty informative, but didn't delve into the issue of when HOAs go defunct and/or the separate but also egregious issue of Deed restrictions. 

Here in WV there is very little in terms of land use control and HOAs are the norm (thanks WV State Code 36B). For my county, there are plenty of HOAs, but they are either defunct, or only do the barest minimum. It creates issues when trying to formulate any type of land use controls, because the local response is always "we don't need that, we have an HOA/deed restrictions". They then complain about either:

1) nearby development, because it negatively impacts them; or

2) their own development because it is in disrepair.

I was wondering what effects local planners have dealt with concerning HOAs and how much they help/hinder their local land use control...

*I will also apologize in advance if it takes a tic to respond, work is pretty loaded right now.*




I was reading about the concept of placemaking and I was looking for some examples of failed uses of placemaking. Learning from past mistakes can be helpfull to see why some uses work while others don't. Placemaking seems like an concept thats easily misunderstood or used just as a marketing tool for newly developed area's.

Do you have any examples of wrong or unsuccesfull uses of placemaking?
Hi! I still find some of the arguments in favour of car dependency to be rather intuitively appealing due to their promise of convenience and/or their appeal to deeply held emotions. Despite this I'm well aware of some of the arguments against car dependency. So time to play a little devil's advocate. 

I find the idea of direct door-door transportation service to still be quite a hard thing to beat in convenience as cars offer a climate controlled environment all the way up to your destination without requiring you to walk when the weather is relatively harsh faster than most other intra-city modes all else being equal. I enjoy cycling and bikes can replicate this feature in cities with a denser urban form (e.g. Amsterdam) but don't work as well during harsher weather. This isn't to say that you can't find workarounds or that city gov'ts aren't partially to blame (e.g. failing to clear bike paths during winter). Transit can also replicate this feature if it is frequent enough and close enough to the destination, but I kinda still don't find it the same in a way. 

I also find the route flexibility of road/personal vehicles to be somewhat appealing as it can allow for you to change your routing in the event a major hiccup occurs in the road network. Buses can be rerouted if there's some issue with the road, but trains can't. 

I find the cargo carrying advantage of cars to be appealing as it allows me to reduce the time I have to spend paying different stores. I kinda understand the joy of only having to pay once for all my major groceries at one store and only doing shopping trips infrequently as I can find shopping to be kind of a hassle at times. 

Now I think the main issue is that the disadvantages of cars are felt on a more societal or systemic scale than on an individual scale, which can make it hard for many people who grew up in suburbs to realise the flaws of car dependency. The aforementioned arguments in favour of car dependency can be perceived on a more individual scale, which can feel more intuitively convincing than hard data. 

What are some counterarguments to my arguments? And it would also be awesome if data can be cited against them whenever possible.

In my jurisdiction, pedestrian controlled lights are far more common than Hawks. I recently learned about HAWKs from a Road Guy Rob video on YouTube.

Are HAWKs generally safer/more efficient than pedestrian controlled lights?
This is for a class assignment. Thanks.

Long story short, I’m a relatively young lawyer (early-ish 30s) who is coming to terms with the fact that I just don’t like being a commercial litigator. Like many going into law school, I envisioned using my degree in pursuit of a cause—for me, that would be something at urban planning-adjacent. Again, like many in law school, I found that career path less clear than the path to high-paying jobs in “big law,” and the dollar signs misled me down that path. The work I do is tedious and highly stressful, but worse than that, I have zero motivation for it besides a paycheck.

That leads me here. Has anyone made a similar move? Is it possible to continue working part time while pursuing a master’s in planning? And are there any particular planning fields that are well suited for a JD? 

Any advice is appreciated. Land use law interests me, so I’m exploring those options too. But I’m not really interested in just representing developers in the construction of a generic subdivision or strip mall. I want to actually, positively contribute to making great places.
Nearby me there are 2 cities that are 9.30 miles apart and they both have about 100,000 people but a lot more in their suburbs. I have seen people claim that in Europe smaller cities will have rail connections to places around them. But yeah Im curious whether 100,000 people in each city is enough to warrant some kind of passenger rail direct connection.
I don't ask this to make fun of Mexico or Mexicans it's just that a Professor I have has made some comments about how awful he thinks Urban planning is in México compared to the rest of the Americas. (Its weird because he's extremely "Hispanista") 

As a Urban planner in a foreign nation how would you rate it?

These two surely don't fit together, if everyone has a detached house, the sprawl becomes too large and the zone becomes no longer walkable as all the necessary services end up being too far away for most. But not everyone wants to share walls with other people. So in this conflict of interests, I want to hear everyone's opinion. Is there a good way to have your own walls while still keeping spaces walkable?

Edit: Please ignore the typo in the title ;_;
What does the optimal street layout look like to you?
Im currently an american in undergrad and im pretty certain that I want to go into planning, one of my main questions is does anyone have experience working abroad as a planner, not just digital nomad type stuff but actually working in a community outside the us.

Thx
Unfortunately, the arguably three dominant Southeastern cities are largely absent of the pre-auto age design of their Southern counterparts New Orleans and Savannah. However, I'm curious about any thoughts this sub has on how they differ from one another-- which one do you believe has the best existing urban form and/or potential to become more walkable? What are some things each has done well (or at least decently)? What have Charlotte and Nashville, having "grown up" later on than Atlanta, learned from the latter's mistakes (or successes)? 

If you have specific neighborhoods/areas of the cities you'd like to mention in terms of development/redevelopment potential, please do. Or personal experiences/anecdotes about your time interacting with the built environments of these places :) Any thoughts on comparable major cities like Austin or Raleigh are welcome too.

The US, Canada, and The UK have had a slew of pre-fab housing startups that are trying to really streamline and expedite housing construction. Veev, Mighty Buildings, etc. are all examples of companies working in this space. However, Europe only had it's major Modular/3D printed home trend starting in around 2021. 

What's caused Mainland Europe to be slower to adopt this than the Anglosphere?
Hi everyone,

I'm the Public Involvement Coordinator for an MPO. How do you go about finding transportation grants that are available every year or at least available for a few years in a row? Or will be available in the next FY? 

I was tasked with finding potential grants and it seems oddly difficult. Am I crazy? Any tips?
Hi guys, I live in a large county in Florida that has many big cities. Half of my town is owned by this rich county but is smaller and has much more natural resources and wildlife. Over the past year our forests have been torn down and the natural lands sold to developers. We have florida panthers, bald eagles, and other protected plant & animal species but it continues anyways. The locals don’t want another hot spot for tourists which is what our town is being turned into. Is there any way us locals can speak against the current development that was already approved? I know the NIMBY stigma but there wasn’t sufficient public outreach by the county and the only way we can get to a meeting is by driving over an hour. Is there anything I can do as a local to protect our forests & swamps from becomings more of these cookie cutter neighborhoods?

Stuff like this (https://twitter.com/alexfischcc/status/1644130870427541505?s=46&t=KFm4QiRYjZUPUlAu2vyTog) and videos of verbal abuse at the hands of the public always come up on social media.


 Have you or your peers experienced such vitriol or considered leaving the field?  Keep on reading planning is a field with great work/life balance then keep seeing stuff like this.
I know they go hand in hand but i'm trying to decide what to get my masters in. Right now i'm majoring in urban planning and minoring in GIS, i'd say i'm equally good at both of them and i like them both so i was wondering which field has a better outlook/ higher pay?



I'm graduating with my Master's in Public Administration (June), while pursuing a three quarter GIS certification (Spring 23, Fall 23 & Winter 24). The faculty member recently told me to study GIS Urban & City Engine. 

Those in the Urban Planning, Policy & Adjunct professions: What software do you consider to be critical and worth certifing in? Extra if you have an certification suggestions beyond AICP and CNU.
Okay, so the M in NIMBYism is "***My***", so what if a city were built in the middle of nowhere (which means no pre-existing NIMBYs), striking a deal with the state govt to give it special zoning autonomy?

This would turn an intractable political problem into an almost purely financial problem, no? At which point, if a city were built from the ground up to be space-efficient with amazing public transport, the [cost of living, divided by quality of amenities] would be far lower than other buildings and would attract citizens on its own. Assuming you invest upfront in e.g. shops and cafes, then you could attract some digital nomads and pioneers, then some businesses catering to them, and then you'd have a growing city.

So assuming that some entity *somehow* acquires the billions/trillions required to build the bones of a whole honkin' *city* (and isn't marching straight toward bankruptcy afterwards), what sort of economic/social/political challenges would it face?

Yes, I know this is a bit pie-in-the-sky and vague. I guess what I'm saying is "what if The Line (or some other billionaire-city proposal) *wasn't* run by ignorant lunatics?"
So I just picked up this book called "Meanwhile City" about setting up temporary activations around parts of the city to rejuvenate them. I'm quite fascinated by the concept, but can't seem to find more similar content – I had a bit luck searching for "meanwhile spaces", but not much too.

Does anyone have any recommendations for other books about this concept, or can point me in the right direction with search terms?
Currently, I work in tech. However, I have an opportunity to work for a local telecom company as a GIS/CAD tech, and am hoping to use this as an experience building stepping stone to work my way into Urban Planning.

Taking this job would mean a pay cut from where I'm at, and is inarguably a "worse position" (not remote, etc.), but I'm willing to tolerate that if it means there is a potential path towards my eventual career goals.

Do any of y'all have experience with this? Is working my way from GIS tech to urban planner without a masters in urban planning or LA realistic? Or would that still likely need to come down the line.

Please let me know your thoughts! ty




I overheard someone at NPC this weekend say that Wisconsin “doesn’t have” MPOs. Obviously they do because they’re a federal designation. What did this person mean?

Edit: Agree with the comments here that RPC-MPOs are not uncommon. I got the sense that this person meant the state is hostile to transportation planning in some way. I’m not a midwestern planner so I’m not familiar with Wisconsin’s planning politics.
Hi all, I am going to be spending a few days in Copenhagen in May. I am a planning grad student and have heard many positive things about Copenhagen's planning! I'd like to know if there were any specific examples of the city/outlying area's design that I should see/experience.

I know there are many features of the city that I'll experience from just being there (bike-ability, walkability, public transport, etc).  So I'm looking for more specific examples of areas of the city to go experience specific, developments to take a look at, etc. I have several days, so feel free to suggest anything. Also open to any good food suggestions!

My shortlist so far 

* Indre By -  Specifically waterfront and Israels Plads
* Amager Ost - View their suburban/car-centricish development looks like
* The Round Gardens - Interesting suburban development  
* Nordhavn - Industrial Redevelopment 
* Sankt Kjelds - Biodiversity/Urban Farming OsterGro (hoping to hit it on a Wednesday)

Thank you so much for your help!

Hi all,

I was recently accepted into a Masters of Planning program (woohoo!). I reached out to my local government to meet some planners, talk about the profession, as well as some current projects in my city.

I'm wondering if y'all have some insight on the questions I should be asking.What should I be asking to get to know the planning department in my town from the perspective of a planning peer, not a resident.

Thanks!
A lot of old apartments in large cities on the East Coast don't have proper storage. Is the reason because they were meant as temporary dwellings for commuters, and factory workers?
If you could implement any changes, clean up, or create new infrastructure to help High Speed Rail Transit in America, what would you do, and how would you do it?
[https://thedeletedscenes.substack.com/p/americas-urban-heritage-culpeper](https://thedeletedscenes.substack.com/p/americas-urban-heritage-culpeper)

My ode to small-town urbanism, focused on the Virginia town of Culpeper, historically 1,000-2,000 people (now much more due to sprawl around the edges.) Culpeper dates to the mid-1700s and has always been a compact, walkable town which once had numerous downtown businesses that served people every day (as opposed to boutiques and restaurants, with everyday shopping done in the sprawl.)

I've been thinking a lot about the idea that small towns are actually former cities, and that in some ways we've forgotten that. We think of them as suburban lifestyle amenities, and fail to capture how much our history, even in a more remote setting like Culpeper, was both rural and quite urban.

In addition to, and in tandem with, the car, the scale at which commerce is done seems to be a factor in the death of the economies that underpinned these places. Curious for your reactions/thoughts.

Hi for the second time in an hour,

I'll be in Zurich (with a jaunt up to the mountains afterwards) for a few days this summer and was hoping this sub could help me out a bit by giving some recommendations for urban planning tourism. I've asked a similar question in this sub for other cities in the past with great results, hopefully the responses can be helpful for some other folks as well. 

I'm really interested in checking out the rail network; I read Transport for Suburbia a while back and the author really hyped up the quality and capabilities of the transit system run by ZVV. I also work as a transport planner, so I'm keeping an eye out for things in this regard. Obviously I will be riding the transit system plenty, but if there's something notable along the way, I'd love to know! 

But I'm also curious about anything else people would recommend. For example, I believe Zurich hosts one of the world's first cargo bikeshares? But really anything that you all think is interesting, innovative, or even... terrible will be warmly welcomed. Me and my travel partner are huge dorks for this stuff, so feel free to throw anything out there if you have something in mind! Places, museums, people, etc. are all fair game!
Hi again all,

I'll be in the Netherlands for a few days this summer, either in Utrecht or Amsterdam. I was hoping the hivemind could answer two questions for me:

1. I may have to choose only spending time in one city, and if that's a case, which city would you all recommend visiting primarily to explore the urban planning stuff + enjoy a beautiful, diverse city. I recognize that Amsterdam is very touristy, but also iconic in our nutty little planning world. and full of museums, nightlife, etc. Utrecht is kind of a terra incognita for me outside of planning. 
2. For either city, does anyone have any recommendations for planning related sites or activities in either city? I work as a transportation planner so I'm especially interested in exploring the land with some of the best active transportation in the world, but I want to explore anything that you all think is interesting, innovative, or even... terrible? Me and my travel partner are huge dorks for this stuff, so feel free to throw anything out there if you have something in mind! 

Looking forward to hearing from you all, thank you!

Our department is reorganizing and I am try to make a case for renaming my role as a principal/senior planner ( with a raise). Any job out descriptions out there to help explain my proposed role. 

My vision is to oversee the planning work by other staff, but without thr day to day management.

Our current structure is a 
->Development Director
 -> Economic Development 
 ->Community Development
-> General Planning
My city is trying to address the spread of vacant commerical properties, the city in general is very car centric suburbs. What sort of policies can I recommend to my city council person to address the issues, preferably with supporting docs. My inclination is to have fees for leaving properties vacant and reducing parking minimums for redeveloping those properties.

Hi! I'm helping plan a graduate school spring break field trip focused on sustainable urban planning. I'm looking for recommendations on cities to visit that have cool sustainability initiatives (public transit, waste management, green building, public parks).  


The cities have to be outside the US, and need to be relatively affordable (about $1,200 a person) for one week (flights, lodging, and food). We're based near New York, so flight prices alone probably limit us to Europe and the Americas.

Thanks!

Basically I supposed you have a street with 9'x19' parallel spots on both sides and you want to replace this with angle parking on one side. This is a relatively common existing configuration AFAIK. The transverse total depth is 18', but if you just use 45-degree angle parking with the same spot size, you find a depth of 19.8', which is harder to achieve with just paint. 

So I did a little math and supposed that you put spaces on the shallow side of a 3-4-5 triangle, which saves a little width. Then I made the spots a tiny bit smaller. The following numbers are exact:

Stall angle: arctan(3/4) ≈ 36.87 degrees  
Box length: 18' 4"  
Box width: 8' 9"

^ the rectangular space you fit a car into, just a little smaller but easier to maneuver into, so you don't lose much 

Transverse depth: 18'  
Parallel offset: 5' 4"  
Parallel space per spot: 14' 7"  
.: aisle length = 5' 4" + N • 14' 7" where N is the number of spaces 

So you end up with exactly the same transverse space usage and you make it safer to get in/out of cars. You reduce total parking by asymptotically 35% but practically maybe less or more depending on specific layout factors. IIRC modern safety recommendations suggest that angle parking should be designed for back-in entry but it usually isn't so YMMV. 

I'm not sure if any planners will find this useful, but if you want to redesign a street, and you can't give up lane space, and all you have is a paintbrush, then you might find these numbers useful. 

Bonus: Inradius of the triangle that makes up the "dead space" behind each stall is 2' 11", i.e. you can fit a 2' 11" circle behind each parked car. Can put in planters, e.g.

Apologies, as I am sort of out of the loop here, but seeing as Amtrak is looking to expand services over the next 15 years, is there perhaps enthusiasm at the local level to establish some kind of TOD around these services? It seems like a logical step to at least build upon these connections at the local level, no? I know the utility of Amtrak is not exactly local connections, but with these new rail connections being established I was wondering if there has been talk around the US of these leading to other possible rail developments or TOD?



Hello all, 

I know this sub has a N. American or Western European. But I would like to talk about something from Turkey. 

A hallmark of Turkish city-planning is the Special Industrial Zones. They are specially designated areas, that house often most of the manufacturing industry in a city. They are very noticeable by the patches of the white in the immediate outskirts of cities. [Example 1](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.8330684,27.8611962,9864m/data=!3m1!1e3!5m1!1e4), [example 2](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.8224073,29.3847483,23816m/data=!3m1!1e3!5m1!1e4)

The special industrial zones are not only used for manufacturing, but IT and services as well, in the form of Teknokents, which often feel like a more white-collar industrial zones. 

Now my position is that these zones are not beneficial and downright harmful. For most industries, there is no point in separating it from the rest of the city. If the industry is not polluting, excessively noisy, or causes immense traffic, there is little point to separating it from the residential and commercial areas. Which is how the Japanese industrial zoning works, at least [as described by this blog post](http://urbankchoze.blogspot.com/2014/04/japanese-zoning.html). 

But what do you think? And tell me, how is industrial areas designed in your country?
An apartment building boom is unfolding in the U.S. This is a welcome signal as many cities remain stuck in a housing shortage. The shortfall in home supply has pushed many people into budget-stretching rents. Many of the new multifamily structures feature “luxury” amenities, such as pools and easy access to transportation. Washington policymakers are now attempting to address regulations that slow the pace of homebuilding, in an attempt to resolve rent inflation concerns.

There are new plans to cut down a forrest in our neighborhood and build horrible town homes/apartments. We see this all the time. They come in and bull doze everything. Make huge piles of trees and burn them. They they replace it all with concrete. It's horrible. I don't think it is unreasonable for people to want to live in SF neighborhood with homes on 1/2 acre close to nature. I think it is reasonable to not want nature destroyed around you to make way for god awful soul crushing townhouses/cookie box row houses/apartments. It shouldn't be called NIMBY - call it is conservationists, instead? Stop encouraging and subsidizing population growth.
Looking to move to an apartment that is close to where I work. I decided I wanted to ride my bike or walk to and from work because it'd be easier than using my car. The only way that I could ride my bicycle to work would be to either trudge through an arterial, wooded area/field, or a suburban street. The safest and most efficient would be the suburb. It looks like that had a street that went from one collector to another. However, there is a fence that closes off one part of it.

Is this even legal? I've never seen it before and it's honestly kind of annoying that it's there. Shame that the road looks brand new, too. Like they messed up and said "oops, we don't want those apartment residents to enter our nice neighborhood."
Title. I can't find anything specific and was  wondering if anyone here knew.
Just got my first interview for a development officer position at a county. Just wanted to know what kind of interview questions could be asked or any other general tips ? It’s my first time doing a interview with multiple interviewers. 

Job description : Mainly looking a development permits and applications. And assisting residents, businesses, and developers.


If any of you have the opportunity, this conference is a must. I went to the Boston one last year and learned so much. It’s a fun event as well.

There is plenty of research and articles about mid/medium sized cities. But nothing about upper mid sized cities. I personally think this should be a term used more often, because there is literally nothing when I google this term.

Everything about mid sized cities suggests the population ranges from 100 000-500 000, but some cities like Seattle, Portland, Hamilton are ranked as among the "best" medium sized cities, even though their populations average 700-800 000. Shouldn't "upper" mid sized cities be used as a term here?
To all planners with a Finance background or know a thing or two,

I’ve posted on here before, but for some further background I am a 23 year old currently working in the futures industry and am looking to make a transition into the planning industry within the next three or four years. I’m unsure on whether or not I will work for a municipality or big real estate development firm yet. I’m looking to work more on the financial side of planning/develop  and maybe get my masters urban planning in the near future.

I just wanted some input on whether a CFA or CPA will be more applicable to what the business administration side of planning/real estate development does.I will have prior experience if I do end up applying in the next 3-4 year. I just wanted one of these certifications to be ahead of the competition when it came to the job application process, and potentially use that as leverage to get a higher entry level salary.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/127yfuu)
I went to a neighborhood meeting to address complaints about a nearby development. All of them were over 70, so retired and with time on their hands to look for things to get upset about. A lot of their beef boiled down to failure of the city to tightly control and supervise the builders, or that our code didn't restrict their development. The meeting went well enough, they were grateful that we took the time to come out and listen and propose solutions. But as we walked out to our cars, one gentleman asked us about a different project and why it took so long. We tried to explain that there were several legal proceedings at the federal level that had to play out. His response was "That's why we need to get Trump back in there - he'll just erase all those regulations!" 

Cognitive dissonance is fun!



I don’t have an undergrad in planning, but am very interested in switching careers. There isn’t a nearby masters program, but they do have a 5 course certificate covering the basics of urban planning. Would this be enough to get into the field. Would it help if I did an internship while doing the certificate? Western US for reference.


Just thought it might be cool to see some averages across different planning disciplines.
Despite so many cities remaining very anti-human, Paris was able to quickly install lots of better bike infrastructure and kick out many cars. How come they were able to take this step that many other cities do not?

IMO this is a really important question. There may not be time to take the slow and steady approach that Amsterdam has taken over the last 50+ years, so Paris's late but more rapid approach should be taken as an important case study.


Mostly for my fellow public planners, but how does your municipality/you personally keep track of different development approvals, subdivision applications, deadlines, status updates, etc.? Right now we only keep a paper file for each development and try to dig it out when needed to update it. I was thinking of making a running spreadsheet of each project submitted to us, but I’m curious to see if anyone else has a preferred method or technique that you recommend. More so for planning commission approvals and the like rather than internal projects.
Hey there! I have zero government, infrastructure or planning experience. My genius self went to film school. But i've been curios about something and would like to do some independent research on how it would work, not to actually submit anywhere just for sheer curiosity and "what if" wondering.

"What would it actually take, logistically, bureaucratically, and financially, to upgrade the Saint Lawrence seaway enough for a Panamax vessel to reach Duluth MN."

Where do even start to find records to answer this? What about papers on the economic effects of small container ports on local tax revenue?  how do you find out which DOT (state? federal? Canadian?) controls which lock and canal?

I know its a super broad question and the old phrase of "how do you eat an elephant? one bite at a time." applies here I just don't know how to cook the trunk or where to even find a cookbook on elephant brisket.

Hi everyone. What are good certifications to have under your belt? I know in the AICP in the US is a must*, but what else is there? US-based or Abroad?I know some are discipline specific, but I wanted to know what my options are. 

Currently working on getting an ICC Permit Tech certification, and afterwards a Sustainable Project Management cert through Google. Let me know your thoughts 😁

*=Depends who you're talking to. Everyone has different opinions.
Hello! I am going to college next year and I’m not sure if I should study architecture or urban planning. Is it true that it’s easy to get an urban planning job if you have an architecture background? I might do architecture because it seems I can either do architecture or urban planning after graduation. Is this true? My ideal job would be something like an urban designer, where I would design a small area (such as a downtown core, or something like that). Even a mixed use neighborhood would be cool to design. So how would I get there? Thanks!
Not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this, but this is something I've always wondered.  I always thought most of New York's company headquarters were usually based in the actual city of NY itself, primarily in Manhattan, whereas a lot of the corporations in the LA area tend to have their headquarters in the surrounding cities, like Burbank, Santa Monica, Irvine, etc.  Is there a reason for this?  What exactly makes NY and LA different in that regard, other than LA just being more spread out?  That can't seem like the only reason, or is it?
See title.

Hi all! I am a recent graduate from with a bachelor’s degree (anthropology). I want to go into planning but I really don’t want to jump straight into grad school for many reasons. However, every entry-level job posting I see requires a masters. 

My question is, what kinds of planning or planning-adjacent jobs can I get with just a bachelors? Because I didn’t know I wanted to go into planning as an undergrad, I don’t have relevant internships. And obviously as a non-student I don’t qualify for most of them now. Is there any way to get some real world experience in the field out of undergrad but before a masters? Thank you for any advice.

Edit: Thank you for the suggestions, I really appreciate them! More specifically, I’m looking for alternatives to a straightforward planner title. What kind of jobs are out there for just a bachelors that are related to planning but not necessarily planning tech or assistant?

Basically just title, anywhere around the world. 
Curitiba, Brazil seems to be the closest thing I can find.


So ive been planning to read a book called El Mall: The Spatial and Class Politics of Shopping Malls in Latin America. But as someone who lives in the Caribbean, I've always had the opinión that en closed air conditioner areas are extremely useful when the sun is at it's peak. However, many US planners seem to not get this that well. We also often do not have central air conditioner house and schools.

Making a few observations about population and housing, and wondering the implications:

1)Both the world and US population will continue to grow (at declining rates) for several more decades. 

2)We are currently facing a severe housing shortage in the US.

3) The effects of domestic and international climate migration will continue to become more prevalent.

With this in mind, do you think we will be able to build enough housing for the next generation? What kind of political and cultural change will be needed to do this? If we are able, will the housing still be needed 100 years from now?

I know these are big questions. Just wondering if you all have any thoughts. I’d also appreciate resources that address these and similar questions. Here’s a starting point:

There has been a large push to change zoning laws, particularly when it comes to suburbs. The suburbs where a creation to suit the baby boom, and now that the baby boomers are retiring, much of that housing will not be needed. Plus there are the societal criticisms of the suburbs. Before the war, people either lived in the city (in apartments or dense housing units), a town, or a farm. So in a way we are going back to our natural state. I can see cities absorbing the surrounding suburbs, and becoming megacities in the future as zoning laws are changed. There will probably be a exodus of people who will move to the countryside in towns and perhaps farms. What do you think? Feel free to add to what I wrote.
Streets need to accommodate a lot stuff and now they need to accommodate, among other things, automated vehicles along with cars (unless for some reason cars becomes prohibited).

It seems pretty hard.

Anyone have any thoughts on this (or sources)


Hello, urban planners. 

I’m not an urban planner. I’m just a pedestrian who regularly crosses a strangely designed intersection on foot and is rather tired of close calls with automobiles. This is in the USA btw. 

Are there accessible guides to understanding regulations, guidelines, or best practices for designing crosswalks? Are there common metrics used to assess the safety of crosswalks? 

I’m just trying to understand how this all works at a non expert level so that, at some point, when I start reaching out to my city government I understand a little bit about how this works. 

Any guidance would be most welcome.



I don't know if "straddling buildings" is the correct term for what I'm talking about, but it's the terminology that I'll use in my post. I basically got interested in them because there's a straddling building pretty close to where I live in [Southfield Michigan](https://earth.google.com/web/@42.48440714,-83.24446127,206.94274366a,0d,60y,165.23878674h,95.58994311t,0r/data=IhoKFl9OQVNtbnJOUUVvQndMbHBjVV90RGcQAg) near the city centre that goes over Central Park Blvd and I think the building could be used as a template for a unique train station in the metro area. I need to know how other cities do straddling buildings though.

Our historic downtown has been back on the rise due to some City investment, private business investment and a rise in popularity of the general area for an influx in citizens.

Investment has slowed likely in part due to economy and interest rates however there have been rumblings and proposals for vacancy tax for downtown buildings to get tenants in them. 

I’m curious if anyone has any case studies or has seen anyone attempt that. To me it seems almost impossible to enforce and could be easy to loophole and only hurts our small business and property owners as currently they aren’t planning to tax vacant big box or other development.
Is there a job board or email server for planners in the DC area? I am a recent MUP graduate looking into jobs in the area.

The map I have provided is colour coded as follows:

\- Red: utilising existing rail lines.

\- Blue: Utilising disused railways (in my opinion this is the only way the project is possible without completely carving up the countryside)

\- Yellow: Utilising existing roadways (main roads with space for tram/light rail system.)

\- Purple: Areas where new track would have to be built.

\- Blue and yellow: areas that were formerly rail lines, now turned into roads.

\- The Markers represent existing transport links, or areas where the proposed route intersects with existing rail lines. Other areas where stops could be added have been left to interpretation.

Some thoughts about my aims with this route are below:

\- The route aims to avoid using roads wherever possible for safety and to avoid disrupting traffic.

\- Roads which are used are almost all wide enough that the HRT could operate segregated from traffic (potentially taking the road down from 2 lanes to 1) rather than among traffic like a tram would do.

\- Roads were chosen that (largely) do not pass close by housing to avoid objection by residents.

\- The route was chosen specifically to interconnect with existing transport links as much as possible to make journeys using rail and HRT easier.

\- The route deliberately passes by business parks in WGC and Hemel Hempstead to make commuting easier.

\- Only a new transport system like this can enable to building on the new housing that Hertfordshire needs, without making the new neighbourhoods entirely car dependent. It will encourage private sector housing development near transport stops.

Technology makes this kind of system possible. Trams and light rail can handle steeper gradients and tighter turns than traditional rail. They are also far cheaper. The Very Light Rail system set to be used in Coventry is a particularly interesting example of what is possible.
Hi everyone,

I am an engineer in training in Ontario Canada. I am currently working as a Transportation Planner with a degree in Civil Engineering. I was wondering if its possible to become an RPP in addition to obtaining my P.Eng as well. Is this possible? 

Please let me know


Thanks!
Correct me if I’m wrong, but it’s my understanding that angled parking consumes less space (which provides opportunity for less surface area of parking), provides more parking in the same amount of space, and if it’s one way it improves safety by reducing conflict points. So I wonder why developers and cities don’t build angled parking all the time every time. Thoughts? Agree, disagree?

edit: i’m mostly referring to parking lots not so much on street parking but good points being made.

 Just wondering before I commit to anything

My city if Oshawa is currently planning to widen a road to 5 lanes. The road, Rossland, continues through to the next town (Whitby) where it is 5 lanes, and is 4 lanes through much of the city, before becoming 2-3 lanes on the east side of town (East of Ritson). ** It's the 2-3 lane section being increased to 5 lanes**. This means that it is going to contract to 4 lanes in the middle. 

What is effective to fight this? I am writing emails, I have a few strong towns and Federal Highway Administration (which is American, I'm Canadian, but still) reports on the effectiveness of 4 lane to 3 lane road diets. But I doubt this will suffice. The Region (sort of like a county) is taking feedback on their long term plan, and its a regional road.  I am putting out some mailers to people along the route, but even if a few dozen people complain, will this have an effect?

The next step is to extend the road through a conservation area to literal farm fields. Completely unnecessary extension, and I think people will be more active on that. But if they extend the road to 5 lanes, that will increase the apperance of usage and people will increasingly say "well you have to do something about the traffic". Plus the massive costs will already be sunk in new bridges and widening, and cars will already drive more dangerously. 

What I want to see is the road made 3 lanes all the way through, with stop lights converted to round abouts and a bike lane installed. The area has several (4) North South trails, but no East West. This should minimize traffic impacts, keeping it flowing steady at slightly lower speed, and make the area safer for people walking amd the many homes directly along the route. How have people successfully usurped bad plans, or do I have to wait for it to become a dangerous straod for anyone to care?


taken from r/LandscapeArchitecture \- how do you guys think AI will change urban planning? will it make zoning easier? coming up with a master plan easier? gather data, make surveys, propose changes easier? will city officials just ask chat gpt for a master plan (that would probably end up needing little to no editing or tweaking within the next 5-10 years of advancing AI)? 

just curious on what you guys think. i am a current undergrad planning student and am scared but excited about what the future of AI has to hold.



Memphis is starting construction on its first BRT line and I was curious what outsiders think about the viability of [the plan](https://memphisinnovationcorridor.com/about.html). As a local, any investment in public transportation is exciting, but I wanted yall's opinion on whether I should get my hopes up that this will actually help catalyze dense development and less car dependency?  


For context, the stops it's hitting include (E-W):  
1& 2.) University of Memphis area  
3.) a large public high school  
4.) the Memphis Central Library  
5.) a strode-parkway intersection (though it is within 15 minute walking distance of several trip generators, including Christian Brothers University, Brooks Art Museum, Memphis Zoo, and big old urban park, and a 30 minute walk/10 minute bike from the college football stadium, so idk?)  
6.) Our cluster of local theaters, and Overton Square, a bar nightlife area, is an 8 minute walk.   
7.) Strode intersection consisting of a Walgreen's and mid-rise housing  
8.) Hospital, mid-rise housing, 10 minute walk from the Southern College of Optometry  
9.) University of Tennessee's Medical School/Medical industry cluster  
10.) Sun Studios/mid-rise housing  
11.) Minor League Ball Park/5 minute walk to Beale St.  


And then the downtown loop, which includes hotels, 5 minute walk to our downtown basketball arena, several hotels, walking distance to our Bass Pro Shops Pyramid (lol), the central bus system terminal, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, University of Memphis' Law School, Autozone's Headquarters, other downtown type shit.   


They plan to operate at 15 minute frequency, with 10 minute peak frequency. I think it has dedicated bus lanes MOST (ugh) of the way, but not all, and the main two corridors it travels on the way downtown are strodes in the process of being reformed, but still very much strodes.  


Thoughts?



Hi there!

I'm a graduate student from Brasil currently working on my masters and also work with strategic planning on the city of Sao Paulo town hall.
I'm studying the effects of rentist interests on city planning and city development, such as NIMBY movements that interfere on city planning in order to prevent verticalization. I believe that when successfull (and, oh boy, they're successful here in Sao Paulo), those movements tend to keep land value high on their neighboorhoods, reducing available land on good locations and therefore resulting in an increase in rents throughout the city.

By now, I've found the work of Alain Bertaud really interesting and I'm thinking about reading the work of Henry George. But I'd love to hear from you if you know other sources for this subject, including people that disagree with the hypothesis.

Thank you very much!

What are some high-rise projects that are seen as 'iconic' or 'landmarks' with great urban design on the ground plain?


In Netherlands, you can see a pulley to bring in large items from the outside using some external platform elevator. Why don’t more apartments have external elevators to help movers and facilitate the moving of large appliances?
In recent decades, the Uphams Corner neighborhood in Boston has grown wealthier — without displacing the Black and Latino residents who have long called it home. New research shows it is one of a small but significant number of American neighborhoods that have achieved the community activist’s dream: **development without displacement.**

We’re familiar with boomtown tales of the white and well-to-do taking over Boston’s South End or colonizing big stretches of Black Brooklyn and Latino Los Angeles. But Uphams Corner tells a different story.

New research by data science firm Common Good Labs suggests it’s more common than many imagine — and maybe even replicable elsewhere.

Hello,

Im a senior Landscape Architecture student in the USA, and Im playing with the idea of going to grad school. I got into a pretty good school for undergrad but felt like I didn't learn much during my time at university. I want to be an urban planner post-undergraduate, and I was advised that a landscape architecture degree will help me in my professional goals.

 Unfortunately, my department relied heavily on the ecological side more than the planning side of Landscape architecture. I'm talking about taking a whole year and a half dedicated to plant identification, ecology, and herbology. Most of the projects we've worked on were in the mountains or forest areas. I had one class dedicated to space-making in an urban setting(which I really enjoyed), but other than that, I spent two years designing solely for plants.

 I understand that ecology is important for topic to discuss, but I felt like the university should've had a subdivision of concentration. I'm a little upset cause I was a transfer student with only two years to study at the university. I learned most of the technical skills I needed in community college and haven't learned anything since transferring. I don't think im ready to enter the workforce, and I think grad school would help fill things I didn't learn in undergrad. 

I've been reading different subreddits on architecture/urban planning, and im more confused about whether grad school would be worth my time or whether I will learn what I need to learn on the job.
Hi all,

I’m a mid-20s professional currently working in the mortgage space within multifamily real estate.  I have a Bachelor’s in Finance with a Minor in Geography. I’ve always been super passionate about planning and real estate development, and have been involved in several urban-centric community orgs and initiatives in the past. 

I started out in the private financial sector, thinking that’s where I could make the most direct impact on whether good urban scaled development could be done-with my ultimate goal to be part of or run a development firm. However, lately I’ve been thinking I want to begin charting a course to the public sector, academia, or a consulting firm. I wanted to get some input on what kind of paths I could take to get to those kinds of careers?

I’m located in Washington DC, so I’d imagine that might give a boost to finding public sector and consulting work nearby. I’m not opposed to going back to school, but I’d like to avoid significant debt where possible. What kind of paths should I be looking at? Has anyone else made a similar switch? 

Thanks in advance!




I’m applying for a MSc in Planning at a Canadian university, it’s a very long drive from my home but I think it’s doable if I stay overnight on campus occasionally.  I want to study part time and work in planning as well.  

How many hours per week can I expect to spend on one course (apart from class time)?
I have 18 months of regional planning experience. I have worked on various grants, muncipal and regional plans. As well as rfp and rfqs. Is there one of these documents that would be best to show during my job search? Thank you!

What do you think of this? I like it so that the region will have an east west route of its own that is good
Hi all,

Completing my fourth year of architecture at UofT and graduating in June. I have offers from York's MES-Plan and Waterloo's MA-Plan program.

Both are accredited to OPPI and CIP. My understanding is that for undergrad it would be a no-brainer, but in terms of graduate studies, does one have more advantage over the other?

I prefer York since it would be closest to home, but any input/insight would be greatly appreciated.

I've also applied to University of Toronto's MscPL and TMU's MPL program.

Thanks in advance!
Good afternoon everyone!

My name's Nuno, Im from Portugal and I am 25 year's old.

Im a recent Master's in Urban Engineering and I am a Bachelors in Geography and Urban Planning!

I am looking for a job in my field of study (from hydraulics, to transport management, to geography, to roads, to urban planning, and environmental sustainability). At this point the conditions that I need are only the minimum to live, regarding rent, food and transportation. I mainly want to gain experience in the field (I have only 4 months of it), and  prove myself better.

I can fluently speak english and portuguese and I am pretty good at spanish (castellano). I do love to travel, and I lived already outside of Portugal, so the adaptation on another culture certainly won't/wouldn't be a problem. 

Im eager to write any motivation letter and have interviews explaining more of my current situation and my commitment with the employer company.

Thank you in advance for those who are willing to help!

What are the pros and cons to minimum lot Sizes? Should lot size minimums or maximums even exist?

I'm just interested in the topic and how people feel about them, especially from people in the field.

I became interested in city/municipal finance after reading Strong Towns. I know that it has its fair share of supporters and detractors on this sub. Supporters argue Strong Towns is correct about infrastructure bankrupting cities/towns/suburbs while detractors says infrastructure is not a big concern. I was wondering if there are any YouTube videos/blogs/books that do a great job of explaining municipal finance?




I have a background in community economic development and political science (Bachelor's degree and Masters's degree). I am finding myself interested in Community Planning opportunities and wondering about the possibility of getting certified without a degree. I am located in Canada. 

Have you heard of someone doing this? How might they go about it?

 The public parking lot at 604 W Rosemary Street  literally sits on the border between the Town of Carrboro and the Town  of Chapel Hill. In fact, the parking lot itself is jointly owned by both  towns, with one side operated by the Town of Chapel Hill and the other  side operated by the Town of Carrboro. 

If you’ve ever driven a car into these two downtowns you will know that  the Town of Chapel Hill charges and enforces parking, while the Town of  Carrboro has “free” parking and no enforcement of time limits. (Parking  is only “free” in Carrboro to people who drive — everyone else in town  pays for it as part of our tax bill. If only school lunches worked this  way!) It’s a very unusual arrangement, to have two starkly contrasting  parking policies *in the same parking lot*, and[this is why the Rosemary Street Lot is Donald Shoup’s Parking Lab](https://triangleblogblog.com/2023/03/17/donald-shoups-rosemary-street-parking-lab/).
*TL;DR: How do I choose between Urban Policy, Urban Planning, Urban Design, or Non-Profit Management with an Urban focus? In the end, what is really the difference?*  


I've tried to read through other posts, do my own googling, but I'm struggling and was hoping you all might be willing to help me slot the pieces together. I'm trying to pick a grad program to apply to.

Background: I have a BA in Geography and Environmental Studies where most of my classes focused on Urban Development, Urban Geography, and Environmental Policy. I did my Associates in a weird way and came out with an AA in Humanities, where my course work was interdisciplinary and focused on social issues of race and gender (I had to write a letter advocating for completion because I didn't fit into any one program). In undergrad, I did independent research on Gated Communities. It was a review of why people in different countries choose to live in them, and the effects they can have.

Work: I'm still at the first job I got out of college (about 3-4 years in now) working for a state DOT in the Geospatial Group of their Office of Transportation Data. I work with local governments to update the database, data from which is used to report to the feds for funding. I've done work where local governments want to move a state route, where I've chosen the new direction, created a map, and generated documentation that was approved by the state commissioner. I've also created a set of maps used by the winter weather response team for their plow and brine truck routes. 

Interests: The way that people interact with public space and the way it interacts with them. The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces had me hooked. I also get excited about topics like the correlation between city grids and depression. Whether planting trees really raises grades, or is that because people were displaced first. Feminist critiques of cities, and the ways in which they have changed, are good or bad, for women in particular. The focus I tend to take is the way neighborhoods, programs, structures, either foster or deter a sense of place and community. My favorite classes were: Urban Geography, Urban Development, The Politics of Science and Environmental Policy (this was great and was more about what was going on interpersonally that allowed a thought, policy, or theory to be accepted than it was about the things themselves. We read [Golem.](https://www.amazon.com/Golem-Second-Should-Science-Classics/dp/1107604656)), and Cultural Landscapes (discussing how people affect the environment, then how it effects them). 

Weaknesses: Math, Programming, being stuck in one spot all day, and drawing by hand. 

Goals: I want to work in the Public or non-profit sectors. I love the idea of doing the reading, the research, looking at the data, then going into a community to use that knowledge to empower the people towards their own goals. Not a top down approach but coming in and saying "I don't know what you need as well as you do, but I do have tools and expertise to help you get what you need. So, tell me what that is." Then doing the work. 

**What program or type of program is going to support all of that the most: Urban Planning, Urban and Public Policy, Urban Design, or Non-profit management?** The programs I've looked at do include focus tracks with elements of each, but which bucket is best?

Any advice, personal experience, or information would be incredibly helpful. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read that wall of text.
Basically I'm looking for examples of libraries that have gyms. Basically your library card (or free membership equivalent) gets you in to a basic fitness center. Is that a thing? If not why not? Especially with all the barriers to fitness for low income folks in the states.

I know some libraries have maker spaces or tool libraries with power tools so I feel like the concern over litigation from injuries must not be a as much of a thing (is a squat rack really more dangerous than a chainsaw?) There are plenty of commercial operations that operate with just one person and it doesn't need to be a super intense gym. Plus it would help make the library more of a third space

Has anyone ever seen something like this implemented? If so where and how?


Edit: apparently what I'm looking for is a "community center" which I've seen a few of but everyone charges a monthly fee about the same as an anytime fitness type place.

2nd edit: turns out this is a thing in denser places, I just live too close to cows to have ever had exposure to any of them. Thanks for enlightening me!
I have read that Italy's "new" government wants to revitalize plan for a bridge between Sicily and main land Italy. As the government does every 2 years. I did not research why earlier plans failed. Just for fun I tried to think of the best placement for a bridge in the strait while not being concerned about the politics, just the infrastructure.

https://imgur.com/a/ASt3lcx

What do you think. Please constructively destroy this proposition. :)

It is a bridge for motorized vehicles only. If you want to include rail, which you should imo, then you would have to let the bridge end at sea level because many rail tracks already lay there. 

Descriptions from Imgur:

Picture 1: Obviously it need to be at the north eastern corner of Sicily.

Picture 2: I would say here is a good location because it's not too long while integrate able into the existing road structure.

Picture 3: This continental side is also mountainous but not as tightly populated.

Picture 4: On the other hand, the island side has a big city with Messina directly by the shore and steep mountains. I favor the bridge connecting directly to the highway in the mountains because much of the traffic will be going to other parts of Sicily anyway and doesn't need to be routed through the city. Secondly with elevated endpoints it is easier to build a bridge navigable by larger container ships because the road surface would be more level allowing for a "simple" suspension bridge without the need to alter building styles for an elevation change. Endpoints higher than sea level also allow for resilience against rising sea level.
Any way you want to measure it - lowest rents/rent increases, lowest rates of homlessness, etc


Hey fellow urbanists, I wanted to seek feedback on my career goals and things, and how they relate to what I'm currently pursuing academically. I will try and keep it short and concise.

Essentially, I have been taking engineering gen-eds at a community college, and am preparing to transfer to a 4 year university, at which I will be majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am also entertaining the idea of doing a minor in Urban and Regional Planning at the same school.

 I have always been strong in math, and have been influenced by family to pursue an education in engineering. I have also always taken interest in geography/cities, and over the last couple of years, I have shifted my personal focus to hone in on safer street design, public transportation, and a lot of other urban design and planning issues. I am constantly thinking about these things. Car dependency, traffic congestion, land-use, and how the built environment dictates how a society can operate freely.  After an exchange program in France about Urban sustainability, I have been extremely passionate towards learning how I can work in the field of sustainable street design, land-use, and transportation. I absolutely cherish every travel opportunity I have, and want to be sure that I possess the necessary credentials to work in the urban planning career field abroad. I recognize the need for smarter engineers and planners in the United States, however I also appreciate the innovations that are occurring in several European countries. 

&#x200B;

If I finish my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, I feel that I would want to pursue a masters program in Urban Planning. I have already explored a few masters planning programs, and they seem awesome.

&#x200B;

Should I switch out of engineering for an undergrad degree while I can and instead major in urban planning? I greatly appreciate any advice or opinions. thank you.
This seems to be a good time for us all to talk about how various social engineering policies have created the world we live in today. 

When conspiracy theorists bombard this sub and others with craziness about what might become, we should point out examples of existing ways of life -- as in, not theoretical, hypithetical worlds, but the actual world we live in today -- created through various social engineering and control policies and infrastructure.

This is not for the trolls or others who are just not interested in truth or facts, but for ourselves and others who need to learn about how we got to where we are today, and how we can re-engineer our way out of this man-made, socially engineered, unfair and inhumane catastrophe.

So far I’ve got docility, presentable space users, no loiterers by making continuous movement - any others I’ve overlooking?
I'm living in Austin, but I think this applies to most larger cities that I've been to. I see a lot of mixed use developments going up all over town, which is great because I love mixed use. However, the only developments I see are high end "luxury" apartments that rent for $1800+ per month and the businesses going in beneath them are exclusively wildly overpriced coffee shops, "boutique" stores, and other businesses that cater to young, wealthy yuppie types. There's nothing inherently wrong with developments like this, but why aren't we seeing any new mixed use developments catering to just normal middle class people who want to live in a normal apartment that's not a "lifestyle brand" and have normal everyday businesses and restaurants underneath? I know that new apartments will always be more expensive than old ones, but most of these new apartments have so many "amenities" like a pool, gym, yoga studio, conference rooms, clubhouse, etc that I don't see how they will ever become affordable over time, because you're paying for all that extra stuff. Is there a way for cities to incentivize more middle of the road mixed use development? Or do you think it will become more affordable as it ages?

Just curious to see how common it is for planners (public sector, specifically) to act as zoning enforcement officers on top of their planning duties or if it's more common for municipalities to have separate zoning enforcement officers who focus on that stuff while the planners do their thing. The reason I'm asking is I am a planner with zoning enforcement included in my job description and I'm really starting to get tired of it. I feel like zoning code enforcement is a whole separate skillset from planning and is not what I ever envisioned myself doing in my career, nor is it what I ever trained for in school. The constant jumping back and forth between acting as a planner and having to take people through the enforcement process over mostly stupid violations (e.g. parking on grass) feels like too much to handle sometimes. I frequently find myself thinking "I didn't go to graduate school just to play zoning cop."
I am going to be applying to jobs in California (working in the northeast right now). I have my current resume but since I have a lot more experience I’m curious how I should lay out my resume. Thanks!
One well understood key benefit of trams over busses is their permanence and visibility. Being able to clearly see in the street that a tram line runs past does a large amount for development and property values around the line. This is something that even a very efficient bus service can never quite reach.

I recently randomly saw a video on youtube and got to reading about the Nancy demi-tram TVR ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr4EZwZbxwQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr4EZwZbxwQ)). Building this was a very weird decision made by the council there. More disadvantages than advantages, but a key win it does seem to have is the psychological one of a fixed line.

The permanence factor is a tricky one. Its the very expense and difficulty of installation, that makes it something permanent. A very tricky thing to attempt to put a price on but any recommendations of research attempting to do just that? (some kind of methodology basically around comparing property/tax increases vs. installation cost?)

The visibility factor however... this one has me thinking. An idea came to mind, an idea so simple and dumb that it has surely been tried somewhere and its understood why it doesn't work-  how about painting the entirety of major bus lines. A clear line on the road from beginning to end to say "This is bus route 1".

I wonder- does anyone know whether anywhere ever tried something like this and came up with a solid write up on reasons why its a dumb idea?


Attaching EV chargers to streetlights isn’t novel — it’s been happening in the UK for some time (Ubitricity) and at small scale in the US (Flo in LA, Seattle municipal L2 chargers). 

What’s preventing US cities from doing this at greater scale and in areas that need it (like multi-family zoned areas)? For L2 chargers, are the grid limitations the primary issue? In the case of Ubitricity in the UK, they’re able to setup each 5kW charger on lampposts in 2 hours at a fraction of the cost of drive-in charging stations or dedicated parking lots. Thanks!

My wife and I live in the PNW with our two young kids and are both mid-career professionals. 

A few years ago, I received a second European citizenship and also passed that onto my kids. 

We have been talking more and more about moving abroad for a couple of years, likely either Portugal or Italy. 

My wife has the option of starting her own practice and working remotely with clients. 

However, I work as a public sector planner and I’m looking for career ideas that are fully remote that I could work half to three-quarter time while there to earn some extra income. 

Curious if anyone else has looked into options like this that a planning professional might be able to do given the nature of our work? 

If it helps, I have about 15 years experience in both land use planning and community development, as well as a graduate degree in planning. Appreciate any advice.
I'm doing a project on the effects of bill 23 on the environment and planning. I've done a lot of research but most studies are on its direct environmental impacts. But for sure there would be even more environmental impacts from urban sprawl but I haven't found much.  So Ontario planners, I wanna know how you think the bill actually affects sustainable urban growth!!

Does the bill make it easier to develop outside urban growth areas instead of infill and brownfields?  As in are there more incentives now for developers to build housing in the opened-up areas of the greenbelt and outside cities? Or is smart growth equally prioritized in the bill?

What do you think are the biggest downfalls from this from a sustainable planning perspective? Do you think it will influence more sprawl long term? or will just the greenfield removals be built on top of and it's done?

Also I've read something about it taking some municipality powers away. Can you tell me how this might take away from the abilities of city planners who are mostly against the bill?

Thanks for the help!!! 
I've seen some spatial planning masters so I would like to know how this differs from a masters in urban planning, along with differences in what these roles do day-to-day.

Thanks!
First of all, land conservation is obviously good and there are great benefits to giving people access to nature. However at some point it seems that conserving land close to cities is actually quite bad since it heavily restricts the supply of buildable land. Consider Boston, the third most expensive metro area in the country. Look at a satellite view and all the conserved forest within 15-25 miles of downtown Boston. Is that not a bit ridiculous? Do you really need 3-4 giant tracts of conserved land right next to each other when one would be more than enough to give people recreational access? Same in NYC, which is surrounded by an unofficial greenbelt to the northwest just 25 miles away from Manhattan.

The wilderness should be in the wilderness, not within easy commuting distance from the nation’s leading economic centers. *Some* conserved land in urban areas is good; a ton of it is overkill. Now of course you could argue that these metro areas should reform their zoning, build up not out, etc. and while I agree, I don't see it happening as long as it's done on a town-by-town basis. And even if you change zoning, you can’t force anyone to tear down their house for urbanists’ density dreams. What you *can do* is clear cut a superfluous 5,000 acre state forest, lay out a proper street pattern, zone it well (or not at all!), and allow hundreds of thousands of people to live near where they want to live. To make sure things even out, the state could buy land where it is cheaper (the actual wilderness) and conserve it there.

Edit: before I get jumped on by the environmentalists, consider all the people commuting via car from far away places to the job centers in Boston/NYC (and other cities where this is an issue). People commute to Boston from NH and RI, even southern Maine. You want to save the trees that's great, but just know you're doing it at the expense of massive emissions from forced long commutes. 
I am looking for data that should be super easy to find, but the U.S. Census website is impossible. I need population densities for U.S. cities, but the only list I can find is on Wikipedia, which I can’t use as a source. I found them for cities in my state, but I want to do a comparison with cities nationwide. I was hoping to not have to crunch the numbers myself - though I’ve spent so much time fruitlessly searching that I might as well have. 

Does anyone know if the census has a table of densities?
Maybe this was already asked before in this subreddit, but I wanted people's thoughts on this article based off of a study labeled "Does TOD Need the T?".

Here's the article: [https://www.accessmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/11/access47.2chatman.pdf](https://www.accessmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/11/access47.2chatman.pdf)

Here's the study:[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944363.2013.791008?journalCode=rjpa20](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944363.2013.791008?journalCode=rjpa20)

In the study, the author first noted that rail access, at first glance, is associated with lower car ownership and vehicle travel. The author also noted the possibility that the age of housing could be a predictor of car ownership because the new housing and rental units near rail were typically smaller, and these housing types attract households who may potentially drive less because they're typically younger, lower income, and have fewer children.

However, after the author controlled for other factors like parking availability, housing type, bus availability, population density, and other built environment factors, he found that neither rail access nor housing age were significant factors in predicting car ownership, commutes to work, or commutes to the grocery store. Reducing on and off-street parking availability as well as increasing the number of bus stops within a mile radius had a more signficant effect on reducing car ownership than rail access. Reducing parking availability, increasing bus stop density, reducing distance to the central business district, and increasing job density had a greater effect on decreasing commutes by car to work than rail access. Reduced parking, more bus stops, greater job density, less distance to downtown, and of course, closer access and higher density of grocery stores, had a greater effect on reducing car commutes to grocery stores than rail access.

The author's point is this if I'm not mistaken. Rail is usually pretty expensive to build, and if it turns out we can build walkable neighborhoods that encourage people to drive less and use other modes of travel without needing rail, we should consider doing that. But what do you think about of the study? Was it flawed? Are there other purposes of rail that should be considered? Are there better studies with more sophisticated and less flawed methodology which show that access to rail is a much more significant predictor of reduced car commutes?

To clarify, I neither endorse nor reject this article/study.
Based on title, this is something I am quite curious about. Usually a lot of these projects get blocked or get tons of resistance from the local communities and lot of times fail.

But, I want to know has there been examples in the past decade in America where an affordable housing development was actually built near an "upper middle class", "wealthy" or "desirable" area and the housing project actually got approved and went through completely despite the resistance. If yes, what city or area did it happen near and what was the overall impact on the community?

I know there is a lot of controversial and conflicting viewpoints on this topic, but I don't want any ill or rude comments. I want a good faith and fair discussion.



Hey all! Thought I'd drop by and get some advice.

Some background on me. I graduated back in 2021 with a bachelors in Human Geography with minors in Environmental Studies and GIS from UofT (I'm based in Canada). I'm currently working as a Research Analyst in Real Estate, observing regional construction trends, tenant movements, market trends, etc. Currently making 50K CAD but recently got a 15% raise which kicks in next month. I also have a student loan with around 15K left to pay off.

I've been planning on applying to an Urban planning masters in Sweden in late 2023 or in 2024, with the intention of hopefully working in that country/region afterwards. Working in planning in some capacity has always been the goal for me, and specifically the Scandinavian countries/Sweden as they're among the most innovative as it concerns planning principles and sustainability from the conversations I've had with planners operating in the region. I also just think the region would be a decent place to work and live long-term, for various different reasons.

As such, I've been learning Swedish pretty intensively and have been stashing away cash to support myself during the potential masters - I currently have ~20K CAD saved up with the intention of saving up literally as much as I humanely can.

Linköping University's Strategic Urban and Regional Planning program is one which has caught my eye and would probably be my first choice - doesn't look too be terribly competitive with total tuition at 190,000 SEK (~$24,000 CAD). The most expensive program I've seen is at KTH Stockholm at 310,000 SEK (just over $40,000 CAD).

My question is if any of you think this is a realistic goal, both financially and career-wise. I recognize that I would be taking on student debt to finance this endeavour, while many people generally say that one should avoid paying out-of-pocket for their Master's Degree. 

The alternative would be either forgoing a Masters in general or doing one in Canada, perhaps with the intention of going abroad later in life, which could be difficult without that local knowledge and connections if I stick to planning. 

Thanks for any opinions!!

I'll start off by saying that today has been a uniquely terrible day for me. Due to my mom being a Penn employee back in the 90s and 2000s, I was eligible for full tuition remission to graduate school at Penn. As such, Penn's planning program has been a dream of mine ever since I decided to pursue planning as a teenager. Seven years later and I just got the decision back from PennPlanning; I was rejected. This is the second time in a row I have been rejected from Penn's graduate planning program and it's definitely crushed this dream I've held since I was 15. This feels like it was my best opportunity to get a great graduate planning education for next to nothing, but I just wasn't up to the task.

Anyway, since PennPlanning is no longer an option (unless I stubbornly apply for a third time), I am now considering other planning schools for either this Fall or next Fall. Rutgers is still allowing applicants for Fall 2023, and there are hundreds of other schools to consider for next year. I'm wondering though, is the cost really worth it? Penn was a great chance due to the potential free ride, but a graduate planning education in the US seems to be anywhere between $30 and $50,000. I am already $23,000 in debt from my undergrad (subsidized federal loans thankfully), so another 30-50K on top of that seems insane for a field that doesn't seem to offer that much pay. 

I majored in Geography for my undergrad, with a strong focus on GIS. I managed to get a GIS certificate and am now a GIS technician at a utilities company, which is boring but pays decently. Whenever I look at salaries for upper-level GIS postings vs planning jobs, the salary difference is quite apparent. A career in GIS feels much more boring and less fulfilling than planning, but I would possibly be in much less debt making much more money. Planning has always been a dream of mine, so giving up on it will be depressing nonetheless.

Sorry for the rambling post, I was hoping to get some advice and answers from professionals with experience in these fields. 

TLDR: I am debating whether pursing a master's in planning is worth the additional debt as opposed to continuing with GIS.

I live in a small town that has a main state road going through it. I thought if I could make a couple of scenario pictures to revitalize this area and propose them, that would get the town thinking about how to design its streets in the future. 

I'd like this app or website to take a picture that I have of a typical street in my town, including the main street, and add some more trees, widen the sidewalk, remove the painted bicycle gutter, and add a parked car-protected bike lane or a grade-separated bike lane, remove the on-street parking (our street parking is the type where you drive at an angle and park diagonally as opposed to parallel parking), and do some other fun stuff like that as well. 

Does this website or app exist? I don't have Photoshop before anyone asks.

The town already has a decent sidewalk network, a painted bike lane, and those 1 over 1 and a few 2 over 1 buildings that were built over 100 years ago. The main street is 2 lanes wide throughout the entire town. 

Anything helps, thank you!
Was asked to include an image for a section of our code to better demonstrate what the code asks for.  It is our section related to trash enclosures so theoretically it should be pretty simple, however, I haven't done any sort of rendering since I left school.  Is there any free software (maybe blender?) that can create a 3D scaled model with dimensions to support that section of code?  Do you have any suggestions for tutorials to get up to speed quickly?







Would someone be willing/able to share the final Addis Ababa City Structure Plan 2017 - 2027, as well as the most recent urban development plans or city structure plans for Hawassa and Adama, Ethiopia?

Share your views on the proposals for Oxford Street by completing the online questionnaire here: [https://oxfordstreetprogramme.co.uk/](https://oxfordstreetprogramme.co.uk/), available until 31 August.

  
Westminster City Council has unveiled feasibility phase proposals for the nation's high street and is asking the global community for feedback through 31 August. The plans for Oxford Street propose an enhanced public space with wider footways, better seating, more trees and other greenery, attractive lighting, clearer signage and more direct vehicle routes, all from Marble Arch to Tottenham Court Road.

Can BRT work with LRV to create the ultimate public transit setup or is it better off just using LRV?

Also if so what would stops and routes look like and how would they work together?


Ok, so I just created a new YouTube urbanism channel that shows and talks about urban architecture in central Europe. New video every 14 days on Thursday. I’d be very thanful if you would watch it and write an opinnion. Thanks




This will make sure the bill is looked at and considered by the Tweedekamer.
This small triangular shaped park called Unity Park in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington DC is not well utilized and avoided by most locals despite being 100 feet from the main intersection of this neighborhoods commercial district and directly in front of a five star hotel. 

The park space is a magnet for drug use, drug dealing, a market for prostitution (which then happens in the adjacent alley).

  Local groups intentionally stage a farmers market there once a week to in part help clean out the park at least for one morning but after the market leaves everything reverts to how it usually is.

  I’m a local resident and seeking help on what environmental design changes or suggestions could be made to create positive outcomes in the park and make it a space the neighborhood can be proud of.  

Help me find the best knowledge about how to make this place great.  All ideas big or small are welcome.
Hi! I am entering my second to last year in my undergrad studying Economics and Global Studies in the US. I am interested in pursuing a city/urban/regional planning masters degree and am looking for **advice on good programs to apply to**.

**Some things I am looking for:**

\- a mixture of skill based and theory based education (I want to learn R, ArcGIS, other important programs in addition to the background skills/knowledge that are so important to know)

\- an environmental focus (I have seen that many programs offer sustainable urban planning/development programs-- I am not tied to just a traditional urban planning program)

\- an economic development focus (similar to the point above)

\- I am a dual citizen of the US and UK so am looking at Unis in both countries. I am not sure where I want to settle down but have strong roots in Philadelphia. I have heard that you should get your masters in the city you want to settle in, but I honestly want to use that time to explore a new city/area/country. Is that a super bad idea??

\- employability opportunities/alumni community

Did you have a really great or really horrible experience in a specific program? I would love to hear about it!

I would also love to hear people's thoughts on **whether it's a better idea to wait to get your masters or to go into it right out of undergrad**. I was planning on going straight through but have gotten lots of advice telling me to do otherwise. Thoughts?
I’m looking for examples throughout the country of suburbs which have tried to create walkable  town centers from scratch. They can either be successful, unsuccessful, or still under development.

Being from Missouri, I only know of a few in our state or adjacent states:

Zona Rosa in Kansas City, MO
Legends in Kansas City, KS
Lenexa City Center in Lenexa, KS
Streets of St. Charles in St. Charles, MO

What other examples would you recommend looking at in other states?

Hi Everyone, 

&#x200B;

I would like to ask some questions, I am really into maps and drawing my own imagination of the subway system. I thinking of studying a graduate program in an area that I am interested in, however, all of the planning accredited programs will be two years to complete whereas a Master of Urban Design is only a year long.

So I'm thinking of studying Urban Design, the only concern that I have at this moment is my own future in terms of job stability after graduation (I assume this would be person to person scenario).

&#x200B;

So I want to ask people out there, how are you going with your job after graduating with an Urban Design degree? 

I have a bachelor's degree in Building Science, I'm also an international student looking to immigrate to the US, so not sure if that would even make it harder for me to get a job in this field, I am originally from Thailand but have growth in New Zealand, so my English is technically my main language. 

&#x200B;

I was thinking of studying Special Education or another teaching qualification because of the job stability, if by any chance Urban Design does not work out well for me. 

&#x200B;

Thank you, Guys

I have an undergraduate degree in nonprofit administration and development. My long term career goal is to design small affordable housing communities. I want to pursue a master’s in urban design. I don’t think I qualify for a program where it stands. Is there a 1 year or less certificate or associates program that I could take to bridge the gap then apply for a master’s program? I couldn’t find short term architecture programs near me or online. Thanks in advance

My local government is holding a public meeting to gather the community’s feedback about their upcoming project to redesign a popular bus route corridor. 

Possible improvements include 
* Faster and more reliable bus service
* Better pedestrian infrastructure like sidewalks and crosswalks
* Improved bicycle infrastructure
* Better parking and loading zones for cars
* More and better bus shelters
* New pavement on roads for buses, cars, bikes, and others

The street mostly ranges from 20 to 30 meters wide between buildings. Most of the route has parking on both sides of the street, and then one to two lanes of traffic in either direction. The link to the project page is below.

[Project link](https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/transit-priority-corridors/route-57-transit-priority-corridor)

At the public meeting, what questions or concerns would you raise to the city staff? I would love to see less car-dependency, more bike infrastructure that is actually protected, and more efficient public transportation. I fear of being stuck with a poorly designed street for decades to come! Thank you for the help. Any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated.





 Is there a reason for having large roads next to both sides of the riverbank? of all the cities I've visited, there are always large main roads next to the riverbanks. I feel like this ruins the overall aesthetic of the city (eg: Hong Kong, Seoul). Thank you! 


I don't know if this is the right place to ask this question, but I am looking for suggestions on Urban design journals. I'm a third year undergrad student and my paper is about the impact of urban design in disaster management.

I'm going to do my masters somewhere in western Europe next year with the aim of working in that country (or nearby it) after. Potentially even double up on my masters depending on what I first graduate from, if needed. I want to practice urban design but my issue is I'm not sure what program (architecture, L.Arch, or even planning?) to take as most countries there views the profession as a subset of one of those. 

Here in Canada, it's pretty much free game. Urban design is lately recognized as its own field but still, jobs sometimes go after dedicated architects with experience doing public realm work, solely landscape architects, planners with a design background, etc. 

So, 'urban designers' of Western Europe: what field does the profession in your country 'belong' to? 

I'm not looking for anywhere specific per se, I'm just trying to get a gist of things there.


Hi all, I would really appreciate some help. I'm in school now studying a social science bachelor with urban and regional planning as my minor (Europe based). I've already done internships and paid research projects for urban planners and designers.

I'm very certain that the broad field of urbanism is where I want to be. However, I'm really having trouble deciding whether I should apply for a planning, design, or studies master. I am very interested in the anthropological and design part of urban planning. My dream job would be to do participatory design workshops with residents for example, or carry out research to find out the needs or residents.  What stops me from an urban studies master is fear that it won't be as "practical" as the others. However, I would enjoy both writing policy and designing, which is why I'm looking for some of the differences in everyday lives.

What field should I study? Do you know of any masters programs that do both? I want to keep it as open as possible. Thank you so much!
Anyone know if it’s worth it to purchase the Dutch design manual (CROW)? I’m a livable cities activist working to import Dutch engineering to improve my town and county. I need to be able to talk about specific solutions.

Hi everyone! I'm currently writing a research paper that addresses the relationship between denser zoning and carbon output. Essentially, I'm trying to figure out whether denser zoning reduces a city's carbon output. It would be great if you guys could help me out with these 3 things:

1. Provide me a list of cities (preferably US cities) that have increased their density over a span of time (let's say around a decade)
2. If you can show me a study that focuses on how a particular city reduced its carbon output through denser zoning.
3. Point me to any other resource that will help me out with this research paper

Thank you guys so much, and I hope you all have a great day.
Basically the title. I've been getting pretty interested in urban design/planning, but mostly have gotten my information and exposure through my own experience, youtube, and reddit, without getting a more "formal" education on it. I'd love to get some recommendations for books and/or scholarly articles that are appropriate for people just starting to get into the subject.

Context: I'm less than a year into my first job (title Urban Designer) out of undergrad where I majored in Design Thinking, Architecture, and Social innovation. 

I'm finding I have a lot of down time at the firm I work for even after I ask around for project work and other tasks. I didn't go to school directly for urban design and developing comprehensive plans and projects along those lines are mostly a new process to me, especially since leaving an academic environment where things are real now lol. 

I want to get better at my job and I feel like the pace of projects (at least the ones I'm on) are relatively slow. I was hoping some of you all could share ideas on how to effectively spend the down time I have at work? Reading plans is good and all, but I really wish I had a better understanding of the industry overall. My supervisors are suggesting doing more Adobe and Modeling tutorials which truly bore me to tears. I want to get better at developing better urban design concepts on a conceptual level, but I haven't worked at a scale this large.

Any resources or tips would be much appreciated. Many thanks 

Sincerely,

I recently moved to a sort of suburb of a city. The city is 56,000, the suburb I live in is around 10,000. I don't have a car, so I've been relying on public transit, the bus. So far the experience has not been nearly as bad as I hear people complain about on the internet. 

The route that services my area doesn't go into any neighborhoods, but stays on the main arterial/collector road, which every commercial business is on. This works out for me because my apartment is right off of the arterial, but also, no suburb development stretches more than a half mile from the main arterial, so it's not the most difficult walk to a bus stop (but not ideal). 

The bus will essentially stop anywhere it sees people waiting on the sidewalk at an intersection; there are few signs to indicate the official stops and no bus shelters, so I had to learn this by contacting the bus system's Facebook page, which has been extremely responsive and active (very good customer service). 

So, the bus is relatively easy to get to, and it will stop at any of the commercial areas in the suburb because they only exist along the route/arterial road. The main issues are lack of bus signs and shelters. Another issue is the frequency; one bus every two hours from 5 am to 7 pm. It loops to downtown and back, so if I want to take the bus to somewhere along the arterial for groceries, I have 45 minutes to shop or do whatever before it loops back. If I miss that, it's a two hour wait for another bus. 

Plenty of room for improvement, but I don't feel trapped in the suburbs at least. It could be far worse.


There are a ton of evidence, calculations that show that if you close a street from cars or at least restrict them more businesses will open and they make more money and at the end of the day they pay more tax to the cities. 

But somehow everywhere in the world cities prefer parkingspots for cars. You can have 15 person with 15 bikes instead of 1 person with 1 car on the side of the road but cities still prefer the car. 

Even after you show them hard evidence they choose the worse option. 

Why? Is there a scientific explanation for this?

Edit: I am not really talking about the US, its beyond saving, my question is about the rest of the world.
Hello,

I'm an aspiring Urban Designer, and I'm trying to plan way ahead for my internships. I want to work for an Urban Design and Planning firm that would send me around the world; I'm especially interested in how to implement transit into Transit Oriented Development. I've found WSP so far as a good multinational firm, however their spots for Urban Designers seem to be limited, especially for interns. At the very least, I'd like a firm that can give me an easy transfer to Scandinavia, preferably Oslo, Copenhagen, or Malmo. Anyone know any other huge companies I should look around at?



Hey, I'm working on a project related to city planning and transportation. We've spoken to a few people in public services and urban development to understand their needs for building smarter cities. A lot of them wish to use data for better decision-making, but it seems like they're not doing it yet. I'd like to know what you think about this.

Idea 1: There's not enough good-quality data available.

Idea 2: The data is available, but they're not sure how to use it.

Idea 3: They have the data and know how to use it, but other issues like politics are in the way.

Idea 4: We're already making decisions based on data and current plans are heading in the right direction.

What do you guys think of the direction of the city planning committee of Charleston? I think it's extremely progressive for a small appalachian city.

I have a bachelor's degree in a completely field but want to now work in urban planning or urban design. I have no experience in this field at all but am so fascinated with it. Should I go back to school or just find a job? I'm from the United States but don't want to go to school or work there if I can help it. I'm also not sure if i need to get a bachelor's in a similar field or if i can go straight to masters. Please help me out with any recommendations. Thanks
Hello all! I live in the center of Charlotte, NC and am planning on making a series where I challenge myself to live car free for a month and document the process. Charlotte was ranked as the worst city over 1 million residents in average miles driven per person, and I think this challenge would be a good way to document the shortcomings of public transportation that many American cities face. 

I’m looking for advice on what metrics I should track (my commute times, emissions) or any other stats to make this video series more appealing. I also would like to include a travel distances, with ideally one trip going out of state.

If this goes well, I think it would be cool to start a movement where people challenge themselves to live car free for one week every year. With the ever growing urban planning movement, I think something like that could really catch on, and bring awareness to our cause.


My small home town built a streetcar line in 1902 with a population of 2,000 people. It had an urban area with "streetcar suburbs" spanning no more than a half mile radius around the town center/downtown. Population peaked by 1920 at 3,500 people, population declined by 10% by 1930, street cars were gone by 1940. 

Personally, I find it hard to believe a town so small could have ever supported a private street car line for four decades, even before the car.

Hello guys, I wanna ask u guys about the Architecture training program at Global University. I try to find but I don't have any information about this. Can u guys help me?

I'm staying on a long, windy, quiet street, very dark at night. Lots of deer and other animals. 

I was thinking, forget about getting people to actually slow down so they/we stop running over animals, but I just go to thinking -- does \_anyone\_ have speed limit signs that list different speeds for day and night speeds?

In theory, people just know that they should go 'x %' slower at night, but i think it could be helpful to see an actual limit.

So, for example, maybe somethign like the image below -- evern seen something like this on a neighborhood or city street?

&#x200B;

[I guess this is two signs, technically, but same idea](https://preview.redd.it/imfkh8ese44b1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a45f97e4c9cfe4fb6c1c1d1d1e3613178021ec1)
The blue boundary is the census designated area of Cross Lanes, unincorporated. 10,000 people live within its borders. It is a relatively flat/rolling hills valley, which is why it started developing in the 60s as a suburb of Chalreston, WV; flat land is rare in WV and quickly fills up, as it did in this case. All of the good land to be developed on has been developed with low density housing and commercial real estate. 

The red line is Big Tyler Rd, the one main road running through the town that all the subdivisions connect to. Essentially all of the businesses in Cross Lanes enter/exit directly onto this road, as well as many single homes and slightly higher density rowhouses and apartments. The lower density subdivisions have single roads that arm off of it and into their respective developments. 

The bright blue dashes are the stoplight intersections. During rushhour, it typically takes 15-20 minutes to get from the farthest intersection to the interstate. Not in rush hour, it can take three minutes to travel the 2 mile stretch.  

Urban planner enthusiasts, what can be done about Cross Lanes, specifically congestion? This fall, our MPO is having a meeting to reevaluate the MTP. There is one committed project to help fight the congestion... adding another two lanes 😑.

I'm developing a presentation to present to the council on how to improve quality of traffic in Cross Lanes; not just cars, but public transit, pedestrian, and cyclist traffic. I'm hoping to throw out some ideas so at least one will stick.

My only idea so fat is to replace the intersections with roundabouts, but I need more input. Let's get some discussion going!

With culdesac Tempe almost completed, where do you think will be their next location?
I received a proposal for residential development in a suburban area/low density residential area - typical lot sizes of the area have 20 meters (65') of frontage and 80 meters (260') of depth.

I have issues with the design of their site plan, but I am not sure how to articulate it to the property owner or their engineering consultant. Their engineering consultate has little to no land use planning or urban design experience. To be clear, I do not have an issue with the density being proposed.

They are proposing residential development consisting of townhouses and apartments. Access would be granted through a private roadway.

I noted that they should hire the expertise of an urban designer, and also noted that there should be better pedestrian connections to Bush Street given that there are bus stops there and that Bush Street is used by cyclists. They responded by adding a pedestrian path along the northerly portion of the site. They did not aquire any third party urban design expertise.

I am by no means a design expert (so feel free to call me out if my opinion is totally off base), but the site plan looks very inward looking. The apartment groupings are like their own isolated pods. I have included an image: the site plan on top is the site plan that they submitted. The bottom site plan is what i drafted in 1 minute, which i feel is more appropriately designed. Do you have any advice on how i can better and more descriptively explain the issues with their site plan? Secondly, any advice on where i can learn more of these urban design skills that can better help me evaluate site plan submissions?

In the event that a 2 lane road gets congested enough that emergency vehicles aren't able to make it past, and as drivers can't move out of the lane to allow passage in 2 lane roads, how do we design protected bike lanes so they don't impede emergency vehicle access on those roads? In the new world, they typically involve concrete blocks protecting a bike lane level with the road rather than the sidewalk, which can be problematic for emergency vehicles when the bike lane isn't wide enough to accomodate it.

I'm sure the Dutch have a solution somewhere, but I'm not too sure about the specifics. Do inform me of other solutions too.



Hi all, I am thinking of getting a masters in urban planning in France (for reference, I'm American). I know this is the design sub and not for planning, but the planning sub doesn't allow education questions so I thought the domains were close enough to try and ask something.

Anyways, I am wondering if getting a masters in Europe would affect my ability to get a planning job in the US further down the road due to different educational standards/ curriculum/ certifications. Also, if anybody has any advice as for what to look for in a program, it would be much appreciated!



Municipal policies and general development trends are requiring municipal planners to encourage infill/intensification development in existing neighbourhoods. Part of this is to reduce red-tape and permit such developments as of right rather than requiring a rezoning or minor variance application.

Cue the front yard parking prohibition. To meet parking requirements, applicants are often proposing to have a parking spot within the first 7-metres of the front lot line. The 7 metres of the front lot line is the font yard as per zoning by-law. Parking spots are not permitted in the front yard.

Before removing, or modifying this front yard parking prohibition, I would like to understand the rationale behind it. Is this prohibition truly needed, perhaps, can it be reduced to just being within the first 3 metres of the front lot line? Does this regulation serve a purpose from an aesthetic, pedestrian safety, snow plowing streets, or any other perspective?

From a pedestrian/road safety standpoint, I an understand why you would not want a car flush with the sidewalk, as beofre you notice a car is coming out of the driveway, it is already too late and boom a pedestrian, cyclist or travelling car has collided with the exiting car.

I tried posting this in the urban planning page and it get auto-removed. Hoping it gets posted in this.
Being Brazilian I remember hearing about Curitiba being a sustainable, affordable, affordable transport, creative (lots of libraries throughout the town) etc city. How it was one of the developing worlds best. Then Colombia, with Medellin and Bogota, expanded BRTs and gondolas for mobility, sports educational programs woven into the urban fabric to reduce crime etc. those seem to have stagnated. Kigali in Rwanda has been serious in its public image and is Africas cleanest city, a nationwide program is used to clean infrastructure but IDK how I feel about that I don't know the details well but it seems to be little authoritarian. Anything else coming out of Latin America, Africa, Middle East (not gulf coast countries), south and Southeast Asia, east Asia?

What country are you from and do you think the Dutch, Spanish or Japanese school of urban design would best fit your country?

I'm from Brazil which is huge and has it's capital in the middle I think the Spanish system would work best here, fast reliable train transportation between the hubs and capital in the center and maybe slower yet still reliable forms like buses and trams in denser built areas like in northern Spain. Mixed used housing in cities, multi modal transportation in cities, livability and sociability emphasized tree coverage and walkability



Red, Yellow and Silver lines are commuter rail operating Staedler GTW at up to 110mph, all other lines are hybrid over/underground metro lines operating Kawasaki 7000 series at up to 75mph
I live in a rural neighbourhood about a 20-minute drive further than the closest suburb. Our neighbourhood is about 40 homes in a semi-circle orientation, where both ends of the street connect to the same main road. There is no traffic on the street other than residents, visitors and delivery drivers. Most homes are occupied with young families.


We have a neighbourhood Facebook group and many of the residents feel the need for traffic calming initiatives to slow down traffic. Although our street is in a semi-circular design, there are many wavy twists and turns. Often, children are playing and walking along the roads, some even have nets and play ball hockey. 

I do not have children myself and understand the desire for safer roads and slower traffic, but I'm not sure what traffic-calming interventions could be implemented. I suppose some speed bumps?  Are these proven to effectively reduce speeds and make streets safer for pedestrians?

Our research study involves the evaluation on whether a particular road section is suitable/feasible for pedestrianization. However, last minute, our professors are asking on whether we should use a simulation software in order to validate the results. Quite frankly, we're just students yet and have no idea on how or on whether the PTV Vissim/Viswalk is even applicable/necessary for our study. We have tried familiarizing ourselves with the software, but to no avail, we could only find tutorials for signalized intersections online.  If any of you could help us, it would be life-saving. Thank you so much

 Here is background info on the project (I am 2nd year mechanical engineering major working on urban design project)

"Context: Urban planning in many cities reduces walkability, endangering pedestrians and causing ecological harm.

Issue: The lack of attention to pedestrian safety and ecological sustainability in urban planning has led to an increase in traffic congestion and air pollution while also creating a hostile environment for pedestrians and cyclists.

Relevance: This problem is important to address as it affects the safety and well-being of city residents and has significant environmental implications.

Objective: The goal of this study is to identify the key factors contributing to poor urban planning, to explore potential solutions to improve walkability and reduce ecological harm, and to develop a framework for sustainable urban planning that prioritizes pedestrian safety and ecological sustainability.

To arrive at this final problem statement, our team engaged in a collaborative process of brainstorming, research, and discussion. We first identified the main issues related to urban planning and discussed their significance and impact on both pedestrians and the environment. Then we did research to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges surrounding urban planning and the various stakeholders involved. We then looked at radical solutions (like eradicating cars completely, redesigning existing big cities entirely, etc.) to see the pros and cons of the extreme ends of the solution spectrum. We also looked at less radical solutions (like wider bike lanes and sidewalks, fewer lanes on roads, etc.) and considered their feasibility and effectiveness as well. Throughout the process, we sought feedback from each other and incorporated different perspectives to arrive at a problem statement that addresses our focus but does not limit the potential of our project. "

I am looking for any opinions (complimentary or critical) or concerns that you may think of involving legal issues, stakeholders (direct and indirect), feasibility, cost, and timeline of such a project.



Currently looking to do Bachelor's in the Urban Planning/Urban Design field. I see a lot of people saying on this subreddit that the best way to get into Urban Design is to do a Landscape Architecture major/master, but I was wondering how possible it is to get a job in Urban Design with a Urban Planning major with a specialisation in graphics instead. I find street design very engaging and would love to work in it.

Thanks in advance to anyone who responds/helps me out  :)

Ive noticed as of late there is no sign of community in the area i live, there is a few big stores and a town sqaure but outside of that there is nothing. I live in a swedish town with a population of around 7000 (most living downtown) but there is a lack of community or connection between citizens, no signs anyone even lives here, Most streets are dead and outside of shopping centers you will not find a pop up stand or anything of such sort

Ive learned that sweden has quite strict zoning similar to the usa where you cannot start a shop in your yard even if you own the land and we have quite strict density restrictions in most areas. Setback rules around most main roads who used to be for buisness now turned into arterials leading to dead spaces where citizens used to thrive and deppresing gray landscapes nobody wishes to exist in. If you want to start a company you would need to buy a plot of land in a commercial area and than go thru a long process of aprovals to build anything on it. I feel that this makes it almost imposible to start a company as there is to much risk and you would need alot of initial investment which people just dont want to risk, is this assumption correct?

how would one fix this? Id like to speak to the urban planning and political office about changes in community standard to create a more connected and rich area with culture and community but i dont want to give misguided advice

Sorry about bad english, wrote this in a rush



Hey guys. I'm looking for a good online flood map. Yes, I know there is the FEMA website but I'm finding its layout impenetrable. What I need is just a box to enter an address in and then, I hope, get a result about flood risk. 

If it matters, I'm looking in Washington state, USA.
Continuation of my first inquiry: [What traffic calming devices could i use for this kind of road?](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbandesign/comments/12v4ajf/what_traffic_calming_devices_could_i_use_for_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

here's my take (based on the suggestions on first post) on to reducing the speed of oncoming traffic when entering the curved part of the road, transition from the original 4 lane to 2 opposing lane, adding a rumble strip in the middle, a bike lane, and a extending the sidewalk. Is this good? what can I do to improve the design?

 **From Chapter 5 of The Death and Life of Great American Cities:**

Cities are full of generalized parks that can hardly be expected

to justify themselves, even if their districts are successfully enlivened.

This is because some parks are basically unfitted, whether

by location, size or shape, to serve successfully in the publicyard

fashion I have been discussing. Nor are they fitted by size

or inherent variety of scene to become major metropolitan parks.

What can be done with them?

Some of these, if sufficiently small, can do another job well:

simply pleasing the eye. San Francisco is good at this. A tiny

triangular street intersection leftover, which in most cities would

either be flattened into asphalt or else have a hedge, a few benches

and be a dusty nonentity, in San Francisco is a fenced miniature

world of its own, a deep, cool world of water and exotic forest,

populated by the birds that have been attracted. You cannot go

in yourself. You do not need to, because your eyes go in and take

you farther into this world than feet could ever go.
It's my understanding that a lot of our urban planning problems in America stem from poor laws and a cloud of engineering regulations that prioritize speed of cars and ignore quality of life.

Which departments are most responsible for having a negative impact on good urban design planning?
I'm currently undertaking a mock urban design project to help secure a job in the field of urban design (I'm an architecture graduate). 

The location I have chosen is in Tanzania, Africa. The site is located next to a poor community, perhaps a little richer than your typical slum. The neighbourhood which I'm designing is also not intended to be populated by the richest inhabitants of the city, however there will obviously be some disbalance between the quality and wealth of the existing community and the one I am designing.  

My goal is to ensure that the edges of my designed neighbourhood are as welcoming as possible. In other words, to create the opposite of a gated community. I do not want to create a scheme which sticks out like a sore thumb and creates unnecessary hierarchies between neighbouring communities. 

Does anyone have any ideas or relevant precedents on how to design neighbourhood/community edges that are inviting rather than unwelcoming?

Thanks.




I'm passionate about urbanism and building better cities and am trying to learn more about the space but have no formal background in it.  What resources do urban planners have available to them when working on projects? Besides municipal data that I imagine varies from city to city, is there any good 3D modeling software out there? 

Just feels like we hear about new breakthroughs in the start-up world with regard to EVs and Micromobility but never any tech breakthroughs for planners. My sense is that without improvements in infrastructure (bike lanes, transit, etc), none of those other breakthroughs would matter. Any of you know of tech innovations in the planning space?





I'm asking this because my city is currently planning a BRT (more like a dedicated right-of-way) in the densest part of the city, which will be used by all transit lines (buses, trolleybuses) that pass through it. 

P.S. They chose the BRT because they didn't have enough money for a tram. But they are making it, so that conversion to tram would be easy, a.k.a. building it like tram infrastructure but without rails. 

There have also been mentions of possible extensions, branches of the BRT into surrounding neighbourhoods.

So I wonder, what do you think of this project and should the city invest in such right-of-ways in the future? Or should the city invest in other things?

Answer this question as broadly as you like. I want to hear some of the nice things you’ve seen in smaller cities or maybe larger cities that have a bad rep. 

For me I love the historic feel of downtown Saint John NB; it has so many old duplex buildings that you don’t see a lot of in Canada



Hello, I am a worker in an ad agency and I am right down desperate. :´) 

I am supposed to write an article full of data on how human-scale urbanism affects employees in a positive way but I cannot find any numbers to prove this. :/ 

I have read Jan Gehl´s Cities for people and went through numerous pages. Please, by any chance, do you know about something? I would be very thankful!


I’m a landscape architect with more than 3 years of practical experience in the UK. I recently graduated from an MSc in city planning and urban design and was initially hoping to pursue a career in urban design. 
However, recently I’ve had some second thoughts about the path I chose as I started getting frustrated with the hierarchy and slow development within the field. More importantly, I am frustrated with the low pay and overall future financial potential of these disciplines. I understand that with experience comes higher pay, and working for a private consultancy can get me up to 60k pounds with time. But we’re talking 20-25 years from now. Friends of mine, in other industries, started their careers as graduates with 60k base salary.

Basically, I want financial independence, and I want to feel like I can afford anything I’ll want. Without overthinking and budgeting. 

The thing is I am very passionate about cities, the built environment, developments and anything that influences our physical surroundings. I don’t want to leave this world and sell my soul to a random tech company. 

I was trying to think of potential career paths I can divert to, that will still focus on cities and their development, but will give me better financial stability and higher pay. 

Things I thought of so far are:
1. Work for a developer as a development manager or analyst of some sort. 
2. Try to switch to the prop tech industry and find a role that fits my skills there. 

I know there must be loads of more ways to get what I want from the world I am passionate about. 
Any advice and ideas would be highly appreciated!


Hey! I don't have an architecture/urban design background, but find myself working on a project that involves making such illustrations. Which software could I use to make them?

What is your opinion?
I was recently admitted into a dual degree program for Architecture and Urban Design, along with a dual degree program for City and Regional Planning and Public Policy program.

The city and regional planning and public policy program recently gave me a 100% tuition scholarship to attend their program for all three years, where I would be able to have a concentration in urban design under my planning degree

The architecture and urban design program offered me a $7,000 research assistantship, and opportunities to travel, because they have two mandatory study abroad opportunities, and more optional ones. However, the cost would be about $40,000 for all four years

At the end of the day. I would like to become an urban designer, and I was told that both degrees go into urban design. I am deeply interested in architecture and urban planning as well, but which one would be more worthwhile in the long run for my career goals?

Important information: I do not come from money. So my entire COA would come out of loans. I just need to know which direction is more worth the money?

Please help me, I only have 3 more days to make a decision.
 Hi Everyone, I've been invited to speak at a InDesign Enthusiast group and will be talking about how InDesign is used by professionals in the environmental design fields.

I was just trying to gather some thoughts about how everybody uses InDesign at work everyday and if there's anything you guys think would be super interesting for people. For example, one of the topics I will be covering is scaled drawings in InDesign - I think it'll be such a cool concept for people that have never worked with measured drawings before!




Hi, if you have some free time and live in a city, please, fill out this survey for a school project about life in the city. It would be very appreciated!
The survey results will be used for statistics, they are anonymous.
Suggestions on how to improve the survey are also greatly appreciated. :)

I’m interested in urban design as a career, I understand that it’s not really a protected profession like architecture or planning, so that makes it all the more confusing on how to become an urban designer. 

So for the professionals here, I’m curious on what ur education background is, and how you got into urban design? 

Rn I’m currently working towards my bachelor of urban planning (accredited).


Hello Redditors,

I am a self-employed urban designer. I quit a large studio to pursue my vision in work. It's been a year since I started designing the way I want, and it has been a wonderful journey so far. My own design made it to a shortlist in the international urban design competition.

However, It's always hard to find new projects to work on. My clients are urban design studios that trust me, so I am reaching out to the Reddit community for some advice on what should I do to grow my professional network? What methods do you use to network as an urban designer? If you have any tips or tricks that worked for you, please share them in the comments.

Thank you in advance for your help and advice.

Gornja Stubica is a village/municipality in North-West Croatia (Europe) with barely 5.500 inhabitants, as you can see on a map bellow. As the area is very dense regarding population, there are also many other small hamlets linked to the mentioned municipality - easily accessible by foot or in some cases by local bus or rail lines - in case they're too far away.

https://preview.redd.it/d4e2ozjk0hwa1.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=4eb0abe057368cd8e3015b28b58617a6808798db

During 1990's, a private-owned textile factory (encircled with the red circle on the image) openned just near the edge of municipality - it was surrounded by private houses, various restaurants / caffe bars, grocery store/supermarket and a railway station (which represents the terminus of a local railway line).  All these bussineses are mixed up together on the same area where residental buildings (houses) are.

https://preview.redd.it/j8nla9um0hwa1.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa3c2092864f4a37b19799de22a89abb120bfddc

More than 100 female and male workers from that area were employed in this factory during 1990's and 2000's. The vast majority of them were arriving to job by foot, as it took them max 30 minutes walking from whichever part of the municipality they started to go out of the house. Whichever path they choose to walk to work, grade-separated sidewalk and traffic signs which warned the drivers on their operating speed were present.

https://preview.redd.it/boqgafku5hwa1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4edd2d4b9151392ae10b0c52e09238cc1f0e09d

In the factory itself, workers were also provided by shower cabins and a cantine with juice/coffee machines, and chairs/tables, where they were able to eat, drink or chat during the work break. There were also few parking spots in the front of the factory building, for the minority of workers who were arriving by cars - including my mom because we lived in a nearby city, altough, whenever her car broke for some reason , she had no problem using the local train or local bus to reach the work.

Unfortuately, factory went out of bussines in 2012 (now the same space is used for another company whose job is upgrading motor vehicles for official purposes), but I just wanted to give a picture of a municipality zoning laws that were mostly endemic here and that are actually made for humans :)

I can't help but always remember that mentioned case when seeing those industrial areas across North America or even Western Europe...
Hi. Here in Bogota we have "Transmilenio", a BTR system of large busses with dedicated lanes and stations. This is a cheap, fast and effective solution for most cities (Bogota however really needs a metro system). There are lots of people that hate it and would prefer a tram system. We had trams in the 40's and then trolleybusses in the 80's, but they didn't work too well. I know that trams are more energy efficient and don't rely of fossil fuels, but in my experience there are also slower and harder to expand. Is there any game changer that the trams have that I'm not seeing?

Hello everyone! It's me again. I mean again. Several days ago, I received a conditional offer for MArch Urban Design at UCL.(Conditional offer means that I have to submit a higher score on a Language test so that I can get the official offer.) However, I have just accepted the offer for MS Design of Cities at SCI-Arc with scholarship. I never thought I could have a chance to go to UCL before because I actually didn't have a high score of TOEFL test when I submitted the application to UCL. I actually don't know much about UCL.

Although I have talked wtih the coordinator about the details like the courses at SCI-Arc, I think it's not too late for making a choice. I think now I still have a chance to make a choice between SCI-Arc and UCL. But it's a hard decision for me indeed.

As for as I know, there are more policy advantages for the graduate students of UCL if they return to China immediately after graduation. But some friends from UCLA told me that there would be a greater chance to work locally if I study at SCI-Arc in the US compared with going to UCL and studying in the UK.

I like the style of design in SCI-Arc and I actually considered SCI-Arc as one of my dream schools. But UCL actually is more attractive for its reputation (in China) and QS ranking. And for the most students and families who don't have much money like me and my family, UCL might be a more cost-effective option, I guess?

As for me, I come from China and live in Shanghai currently. And I plan to go to study abroad and stay at a global city like LA, London, to gain more international work experience and get to know more new ideas and things. But I don't think architecture will be my lifelong career. Although I don't reject architecture, I prefer to work in game or movie industry in the future if possible.

P.S.: It's my first time posting something on Reddit. If I have violated any of the basic rules on Reddit or have misrepresented any facts in my post, please comment on me and let me know. Thank u All!

I will be posting this message on multiple subreddits and communities, apologies in advance for any inconvenience caused.



Im trying to find a modern city whose architect tried to recreate European urban design plan from renaissance/baroque/classical period, following most of the European guide rules from that time period.
Hi All. I have two opportunities in front of me. One is a Masters degree in Urban design with a hefty scholarship, and the other is a job offer continuing my architecture career at a firm that almost exclusively builds train stations for the city of Seattle.

I only just graduated with my BArch this time last year, and I'm not really sure what I should do. I'm definitely interested in design for the public good - which is what brought me to apply for a masters in urban design, but if I get off the architecture track its going to be hard to get back on. The firm I work for now has kept me on the schematic side of architecture, and I'm not learning how to actually put a building together. In all of my interviews so far that has been a problem, since learning the skills of the trade is ultimately the most marketable skill you can have as a young designer.

If I do another year of school and try to go back to architecture Ill have the same problem but its another year worse. So far no one I've talked to in the architecture field thinks urban design is bad persay, but they don't consider the degree an asset either. It all boils down to can you do these details for me or not.

All of this being said, I do think I could be a lot happier as an urban designer (on paper atleast) I'm just caught up in the risk and reward of my choices right now. Especially with the cloud of a possible-but-unpredictable recession casting a shadow on the design world these days 

Hoping for any advice I can get.

Hello!, I'm currently a student that's working on application of traffic calming measures. The road that i have selected is currently an accident prone area and i would like to ask for your help as to what kind of traffic calming device could i apply to a road with a curve like shown. I kindly ask for your insight and guidance.

This is a lively, mixed use, walkable neighborhood close to ubc in metro Vancouver. It's mostly low and mid rises and has plenty of missing middle (anything from townhouses to 4 story apartments). But it also has plenty of high rises. Attached are satellite images.

The first shows in red the area with high rises and in green anything between row houses and 6 story buildings. I'd say based on this anywhere between 10-15% of total residential/mixed use development here are residential towers.


I’m an M.Arch sustainable urban design student (2022-2023) in UK. I started looking for jobs in UK or EUROPE . But I cannot getting any positive response from any companies. Can Any urban designer in the community helm me out to how to get into the job.

I’m an engineering project manager helping manage the design and installation of a national network of EV chargers. I’ve had to work with towns across the country to get building permits approved and from first hand experience, the regulations in so many towns have are the reason why everything takes so long and is so expensive to build these days.

Now zoning and planning regulations do have a purpose. I get it if your small New England farm town doesn’t want a super Walmart to open in the center of town. However, most zoning and town regulations are incredibly wasteful, outdated, and frankly don’t even serve the local public interest. Most towns are run by people who have absolutely no technical knowledge and are living in the last century. 

All I’ve been working to do is put EV chargers in preexisting parking lots, that’s it. Some towns are so particular that even after 3 revisions that require the work of multiple engineers, architects, and contractors, they still turn down the application because it “damages the character of the town.” What should be a $20-30k design and permit process balloons to a $100k+ process in no time. Zoning boards care so deeply about the aesthetics of dilapidated strip malls. And don’t get me started on building setbacks. To this day, the people in charge of these towns want them to be built like it’s the 50s. Massive parking lots, absurd “landscaping” requirements, enormous parking minimums. I can only imagine the nightmare of wanting to build dense housing in 95% of the country.




Hi! According to the rather divisive John Forester, the presence of a separated bike lane is less safe because during right/passenger side turns by drivers, the cyclist is in the blind spot, which necessitates turning your head over your shoulder to spot cyclists after looking for oncoming traffic before proceeding with the turn. This means the driver won't bother with the inconvenient maneuver as the cyclist isn't a threat to him and they come infrequently:

>*Under the normal system* ***the motorist right turn... starts with a rightward merge, either into a position on the cyclist's normal path of travel or across it into a right-tum-only lane.*** *In the latter case the interaction is completed; the right-turning motorist turns from his lane away from the cyclist.* ***If the motorist turns into the cyclist's path there is further interaction if, as is usual, the motorist slows for the turn. The cyclist slows down also, or****, if he prefers and if the way is clear,* ***he merges left and overtakes the motorist.*** *This interaction is safe because* ***the cyclist sees the motorist, slows down a safe distance behind him, and can always stop if necessary.***  
>  
>***Under the bikeway system the motorist right turn is not preceded by a merge.*** *The motorist turns from his traffic lane across the bike lane or sidepath \[separated bike lane\]…* ***the motorist must combine the merge and the turn.*** *This requires the motorist to do more than is humanly possible.* ***He must look left and ahead to make sure that no traffic is coming from the cross street, and he must look to his right rear to see if any cyclists are coming.*** ***He cannot do both at once****, because his eyes cannot swivel in such a wide arc without a movement of the head. Given this choice, naturally* ***the motorist often continues to look for the traffic ahead, which threatens him, rather than for cycle traffic, which is not dangerous to him and which is in any case infrequent.***  
>  
>\- Bicycle Transportation 1994, p.136

He then concludes that such turns prevent cyclists from reacting in a timely manner to turning drivers, as the driver merges into the path of the cyclist while slowing down at the same time:

>*The cyclist, moreover, has no chance of avoiding the motorist once the motorist has started to turn.* ***This is not the merging situation****, in which a mere slowing down of the passive driver permits the driver making the error to complete his move in safety.* ***The turning motorist*** *exchanges forward motion for sideward motion,* ***cutting into the cyclist's path and slowing down simultaneously.*** *In many cases* ***the cyclist cannot****, after realising* *what is happening,* ***apply sufficient deceleration to prevent himself from running into the side of the car*** *as it turns.*   
>  
>\- Bicycle Transportation 1994, p.137

This is in contrast to merging before intersections, where the driver/cyclist merging into the lane does so without slowing down as much: 

>***Merging behind the nearest vehicle presents little problem*** *-* ***the merging driver*** *has the other in full view before him, so all he* ***has to*** *do before moving over is to* ***adjust his speed until there is a safe distance between them.*** *In case of error* ***the passive driver sees nothing and takes no action****, but continues to drive straight ahead at steady speed unless knocked off course by the collision.*  
>  
>*Merging in front of another vehicle is different in two ways. First,* ***the passive vehicle is behind the merging driver's normal field of view****. Second, the* ***merging vehicle is within the passive driver's field of view and the passive driver has an effective collision-avoidance manoeuvre available to him… the merging driver has to turn his head so he can observe*** *from straight ahead, where he is going, to* ***the rear quarter****, where the other vehicle is or may be.* ***This is safe and possible only if there is no chance of traffic conflict from the other side of the merging driver's path.*** *If there is the possibility of such conflict, such as from an intersection, the merging driver will look forward toward it rather than backward at the driver behind.*  
>  
>*The passive driver in this case is watching the manoeuvre.* ***The possible error is that the merging driver leaves little or no space between the two vehicles.*** ***The passive driver*** *looks at the motion of the merging driver, and* ***if he believes that there will be insufficient clearance he slows down to produce more clearance.*** *All vehicles possess far greater deceleration ability than acceleration ability, so the avoidance is generally successful.*   
>  
>\- Bicycle Transportation 1994, p.134-135

This is to say that when a cyclist merges into the centre of the lane from the side of the lane (or an on road bike lane) quite a distance before an intersection, the cyclist will be visible enough to the driver behind that the latter will slow down to give sufficient merging space for the cyclist. 

Forester's confusing and verbose language aside, how do [Dutch style roundabouts and protected intersections solve the aforementioned problems?](https://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2014/02/23/junction-design-in-the-netherlands/)

I graduated with an l.arch undergrad a few years back and wasn't fond of the field in it's purest form and really didn't create any exemplary projects. Plus my software knowledge was low as my school prioritized hand drafting and drawings instead of using cad and render softwares...

I work as a junior urban planner now in the private sector. I'm absolutely in love with urban design as of the past few years and want to pursue a job in it,  but now that I know more stuff, should I bother trying to update or 'upgrade' all my academic work to make them stronger both concept and visual wise? Or would it be better to just compile it all already and get working on new personal projects to show off what I know now?

I loved this mingling of infrastructure; cars below, people in the middle, and light rail above.
what is the most annoying thing about your job?
Just like the title, how do we eliminate the slope barrier if we want to make the area pedestrian friendly, and how can main neighborhood roads be accommodated into that slope.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>!Cable lifts (Teleferic) are an outdated idea and have reliability issues when it comes to that issue, and technically you can design a road to pass through a steep area (using that zigzag method) but you'll be left with a not very pedestrian friendly road.!<





I hit a massive wall when I started to design the two main cities (really small towns by todays standards probably), for a game I want to make. I have no clue about urban development, if any one has some answers for a couple questions or can direct me to the right people if this is not part of urban design (I think it is from what I read), that would be helpful.

CITY 1:Population is roughly 2900 residents with 2100 being adults.  
Would 650 \~ 700 households fit pre-industrial revolution era?

CITY 2:Population is roughly 1000 residents with 700 being adults.  
200 \~ 230 households fit pre-industrial revolution era?

What would be a good amount of commercial related buildings for cities this size and is there any specific spread for them?

I can't figure out how to word a couple other questions so for now this is all I will ask.



I'm planning on applying to some urban design roles in the near future and would like to create an urban design mock project to accompany my architecture portfolio. 

Does anyone know of a place to find potential briefs for urban design projects?  


Thanks.
















I know these conversions -- sometimes known as "road diets" -- end up with bike 'lanes' on the outside, but they don't really count as lanes since they are not protected, which is presumably why they are called [4-to-3-lane conversions](https://www.dot.state.mn.us/trafficeng/safety/road-diet-summary.html) instead of 4-to-5-lane conversions, but I feel like some city somewhere must have done an actual 4-to-5-lane conversion -- where the new outside bike 'lanes' actually get protection, so people start using them - to bike in, scoot in, etc.

Do you know of any?

Ideal situation would probably be something like we see in Europe -- grade or barrier-separated for higher speed roads, etc.

Thanks.


Hi I know this might be a stupid question but there’s nobody I know irl that could help me. I’m a junior in high school and I’m beginning the college search/application process. I have a strong interest in really urban-anything, but I don’t want to be screwed over by picking the wrong major. I was hoping you guys could help steer me in the right direction? Here are my main concerns: 

What is the difference job-wise (tasks, pay, etc) between planning and design? 

What undergrad majors would be best for either? 

I unfortunately do not possess the best of math skills, most of my high school classes have been heavily focused on history and politics. I always figured I’d major in political science. I heard that could still be applicable to at least urban planning? I know I’ll need at least a masters in something urbanshmish but I was hoping I could do my undergrad in something that could still allow me to go into law school if i decide that i want to sell my soul for a higher paycheck. 

I’m sure there have been many posts like this before. I’ve heard lots of terrible things about this career path, but my other option is law so I’m set up for hell either way i suppose. I just really like urban design and can’t imagine myself in any other career.








Hey everyone, I made a brand new Instagram showing various stairs throughout New York City! If anyone's interested check it out it's @nyc.stairs ☺️ 

Big thank you to the mods for letting me share this!


I just bought a new flat in a new build neighbourhood in London with decent midrises. It should be ideal - it’s walkable, next to a canal, has some larger common grounds, next to a very hip neighbourhood, and yes it’s more than dead. Frankly, it’s super sterile. It doesn’t help that the common areas are just large plazas with little going for them except for a few restaurants/shops. How would you turn this area into a vibrant, walkable, “cute” neighbourhood like historical neighbourhood tends to be?

I find that a lot of these midrise developments offer sterile environments. I think they have a potential to be great, and keen to know how to make it great.

My dream is to become a developer focused on building midrise, walkable neighbourhoods. What advice/opinion can you give me to avoid creating a sterile environment and instead have something vibrant?
I was wondering if any of you have heard about the urban design programs at cmu and ccny? have you guys heard of any stark differences between the two? I like cmu’s curriculum more but i’m still unsure.



How to get into the world of policy advocacy. I am already studying in one of the top colleges in India for urban policy, but I really dont know anything other than theory. I just feel lost man. My classmates recently got into big fours for internships and I dont know how do i go about it and choose a domain to work in.

I think New Urbanism is overall good—certainly better than the sprawling suburban alternative—but upon inspecting a host of New Urbanist communities, I'm struck by the oddity of their street patterns. They are orderly in their own way, but not nearly as interconnected as traditional street networks. Streets that would be connected in an old neighborhood sometimes come to an abrupt end, and there are sometimes even cul-de-sacs and dead end streets within the neighborhood. They also feel very cut off from the "outside world", with very few streets entering or leaving the neighborhood. Whereas a traditional grid disperses traffic and allows for maximum route flexibility, New Urbanism forces traffic to busy collector roads and pedestrians into sometimes questionable routes. Has the street pattern in [Daybreak, Utah](https://www.google.com/maps/place/40%C2%B033'23.0%22N+112%C2%B000'56.2%22W/@40.556638,-112.0207716,15z/data=!4m13!1m8!3m7!1s0x8752857b82064023:0x5d489afa8e343080!2sDaybreak,+South+Jordan,+UT+84009!3b1!8m2!3d40.5487942!4d-112.0178286!16zL20vMDhiNWI1!3m3!8m2!3d40.556393!4d-112.015622) really improved upon [Old Town Alexandria](https://www.google.com/maps/place/38%C2%B048'27.2%22N+77%C2%B002'34.5%22W/@38.8075672,-77.0450997,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!1m8!3m7!1s0x89b7b053e9d9613f:0x99ba67618731fa50!2sOld+Town,+Alexandria,+VA!3b1!8m2!3d38.8067193!4d-77.0420541!16s%2Fm%2F04swg_1!3m3!8m2!3d38.807563!4d-77.042911)? I think not.

I haven't looked at every single New Urbanist community of course (recommendation for good ones are welcome), but even the most respected ones like Kentlands in Maryland seem to follow the same basic design, and I'm curious why that is.





Hi, I'm currently 25 and getting my masters in urban planning on the East Coast of the US. I don't have an architecture degree, but would really like to become more urban design capable and knowledgeable. Does anyone know of a summer course/workshop/studio/internship that will give me more rendering experience and things to add to my portfolio? I'm applying to Urban Design internships as well, but my portfolio is mostly comprised of site plans, GIS maps, freehand sketches, and one 3D rendering I did in SketchUp for the single UD course they offer in my program. I would ideally like to be in NYC, but I'm open to anything. Would really appreciate any advice/direction

Good afternoon everyone!

My name's Nuno, Im from Portugal and I am 25 year's old.

Im a recent Master's in Urban Engineering and I am a Bachelors in Geography and Urban Planning!

I am looking for a job in my field of study (from hydraulics, to transport management, to geography, to roads, to urban planning, and environmental sustainability). At this point the conditions that I need are only the minimum to live, regarding rent, food and transportation. I mainly want to gain experience in the field (I have only 4 months of it), and prove myself better.

I can fluently speak english and portuguese and I am pretty good at spanish (castellano). I do love to travel, and I lived already outside of Portugal, so the adaptation on another culture certainly won't/wouldn't be a problem.

Im eager to write any motivation letter and have interviews explaining more of my current situation and my commitment with the employer company.

Thank you in advance for those who are willing to help!



hi guys i’m graduating with a bachelors degree in urban planning and design this coming may, i applied to master programs in urban design and got into a great two year program paying for about 40% of my tuition, with all that considering i’m kind of wondering is a masters in urban design really worth it? i don’t really have any interests in topics related to it (urban informatics, real estate) and truly think that i need to learn more design wise, i also interned doing design work and enjoy it
A third place is defined as being neither the home, the first place, or the workplace, the second place. It is a public place where you can just exist and enjoy what the city has to offer.

Has anyone found an even better alternative to Streetmix for cross sections? Thanks in advance!
Hey fellow urbanists, I wanted to seek feedback on my career goals and things, and how they relate to what I'm currently pursuing academically. I will try and keep it short and concise.

Essentially, I have been taking engineering gen-eds at a community college, and am preparing to transfer to a 4 year university, at which I will be majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am also entertaining the idea of doing a minor in Urban and Regional Planning at the same school.

 I have always been strong in math, and have been influenced by family to pursue an education in engineering. I have also always taken intrerest in geography/cities, and over the last couple of years, I have shifted my personal focus to hone in on safer street design, public transportation, and a lot of other urban design and planning issues. I am constantly thinking about these things. Car dependency, traffic congestion, land-use, and how the built environment dictates how a society can operate freely.  After an exchange program in France about Urban sustainability, I have been extremely passionate towards learning how I can work in the field of sustainable street design, land-use, and transportation. I absolutely cherish every travel opportunity I have, and want to be sure that I possess the necessary credentials to work in the urban planning career field abroad. I recognize the need for smarter engineers and planners in the United States, however I also appreciate the innovations that are occurring in several European countries. 

&#x200B;

If I finish my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, I feel that I would want to pursue a masters program in Urban Planning. I have already explored a few masters planning programs, and they seem awesome.

&#x200B;

Should I switch out of engineering for an undergrad degree while I can and instead major in urban planning? Be honest with me please, and thank you.

I'm an architecture graduate from the UK who's extremely keen on trying out urban design as a potential career path. I have experience working in a graphic design studio and also have a short internship with an architecture firm under my belt.

I have no idea how to go about getting an entry level position in urban design, and was wondering if anyone had some ideas which I would be able to use. 

Any advice would be much appreciated.


Hello! I am a student from Chicago, Illinois and I recently started a petition to draw the city transit authority’s attention towards an inefficiency in a specific bus route. This is something which elongated commute times for those who also travel along this street, which is one of the busiest in the city. It also requires extra fares than necessary. If you are interested in signing and support the issue, you can read more about the specifics on the page provided below. Thanks!

Hello! I am trying to learn more about the current urban design trends in cities across the US. I am curious about documents y’all may have come across focuses specifically on design recommendations and/or design policy. Furthermore, I am looking for documents that are city-led (not academic or private research). They can focus on city-scale or specific neighborhoods.

One example for reference is the Atlanta City Design book: [https://www.atlcitydesign.com](https://www.atlcitydesign.com/)

I know most cities generally have city-wide master plans though many times these can be planning policy specific and not get into the specific of urban design of streets and building vernacular.

Thanks!

Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions/examples for how to design a street with reverse angled parking and a bus stop/pull off? Feeling a bit stumped on this one.
There is a lot of talk in a lot of countries right now about the price of housing.

In some places it has gotten quite bad and contributed along with other factors to the rise in tent and shack areas.

I remember when the Burj Khalifa was completed and people were absolutely amazed at the angular design to cut direct wind pressure, the swinging measurements, and so forth.

Are there any examples like the Burj Khalifa when it comes to high density construction done in an incredibly magnificent design and building way?

I was thinkin the old slavic block design as I have seen the testimonials were people talk about how they actually quite like them despite the ugly nature.

I wondered if we had perfected that a bit and what could be great to implement in many large cities as a way forward and that could help so many.



We are working on a large brownfield redev project in studio right now.  All my classmates have defaulted to extending the surrounding grid into the site.  Maybe that's the right thing to do, maybe it isn't.  Either way, when I question the move, everyone looks at me like I'm an idiot. The main defense of the grid extension comes down to 'efficiency' and cohesion with surroundings.  I get that, and they are worthy aspirations. 

However, in my mind, we could apply the same reasoning to having freeways bisect downtown areas, and if it's cohesion you want, let's just put huge parking lots, corner gas stations, and concrete hellscapes on our site so it matches its surroundings.

Meanwhile, look at any european city people like to cite for its sense of place, and where is the grid?  Do you ever say "Florence would be so nice if only it had more of a regular rectangular grid?"  Do we think the people of Edinburgh are constantly plagued by the lack of 'efficiency' their meandering streets burden them with?

Our site is a blank slate and an opportunity to be inventive, and to create something we've always wanted, and my classmates default to the exact same layout the rest of the city already has.

When I asked the professor what he thought, he also defended the efficiency and economic viability of a regular grid.  It just seems a bit lazy to me.

What do you think?
Hi all,

For work, I'm trying to gather examples of U.S. cities effectively using data to tell a story, make a case or communicate a key idea in regards  to transportation.

I'm not looking for any specific type of project; it could be a presentation making the case for a new bus lane, a data visualization tool that highlights street safety disparities between neighborhoods, or anything else. The key is it needs to be from city government itself (e.g. a transportation or public works  department), not an advocate or university.

My  goal is to gather these case studies and tease out best practices that others can learn from, and make clear the value of cities using data as a communications tool.

Any great examples that come to your mind? Or even just specific agencies you know generally do this type of thing well?

I appreciate your ideas!




Hello all! I hope this is okay to post here. I’m just in desperate need of some minor guidance. I’m working on a project in school where I need to redesign parts of a university/college campus and I’ve decided to do an area that other students aren’t focusing on. At first, my professor loved my concept but they’re very wishy-washy and quickly changed their mind. They suggested I design the same area as everyone else but that’s not what brings me passion, so I’m trying to find a way to make this idea work.

My idea is to design all of the under-utilized/under-developed areas of campus that I’m calling the nooks and crannies. The professor had told me this is too small of a concept to be considered “urban design” and receive a grade but they said it might still be possible.

*My question to you is: a) do you think that designing the small- to medium-sized underdeveloped spaces is considered urban design; b) how can I elevate this concept to be a strong/brilliant example of urban design?*

I really can’t thank you enough for any help and guidance you provide!

I know you might have to reinforce them to be able to withstand the weight of whatever aside from humans. Other than that why aren't they being used that much? They can be used for tiny houses, renewables, farming, wildlife gardening, maybe more.





At least with buildings arched over the sidewalk aren't more common than I would like, most of them are in Europe. A continuous awning nor balcony over sidewalks is not what I'm talking but its better than nothing I suppose. They behave like awnings but take up space where nothing else would except for tree lined sidewalks. The protect people from the elements & utilize unused spaces which can ease walking & may mildly increase urban density. I usually see them with in an indoor, courtyard, or porch setting which aren't ment for general public use.
Hi all,

*(I tried to publish this in the slightly-more-relevant urban planning subreddit, but for some reason it keeps getting bounced—apologies if this is the wrong place).*

This is a slightly ridiculous, vague request, but I've been trying for days to identify this presentation that's on the edge of my memory and it's  driving me crazy!

At some point in the past year or two, I watched a virtual event where some U.S. city  official showcased an amazing presentation his city had created to  illustrate the positive impacts a large-scale project (either zoning or  transit-related) would have on residents. The crux of the presentation  was that the city had used a ton of data and creativity to create a cast  of "characters" that embodied various communities or people within the  city—e.g., a young mother living in X neighborhood with Y income.

The  presentation very tangibly and specifically illustrated how the plan  might change these individuals' lives, and though it sounds corny as I'm  writing it, I remember being incredibly impressed by the thoughtfulness of it, and I'm pretty sure it played a key role in eventually getting  this proposal approved.

For the  life of me though, I can't remember what city/project it was for. I  could've sworn it was for Minneapolis' fourplex upzoning plan from a couple years ago, but I can't find any such presentation online  connected to that project. Maybe somewhere else in the midwest; it  could've also been a transit project.

I'm  pretty confident this presentation got some broader attention in the  urban planning world—maybe there was a Citylab article about it, and the  only reason I even saw it was because it was celebrated somewhere  online (I'm from New York, and I know it wasn't from here).

I know this is incredibly vague, but does this ring a bell to anyone?? Would love to find this presentation somewhere.


 Has anyone designed a two way cycle track that is riding on the left side instead of right side? Is it even legal since vehicle code has stated that the vehicle needs to drive on the right side; and bike basically follows the vehicle code?

Hi guys, was in a London the other day and came across these highly controlled (but very pleasant) privately-owned public squares that seemed to be very pleasant. Do you think these are a good alternative to government-owned underfunded, under-managed space in London? Quite an interesting debate as for me I felt quite welcomed and safe but can see how for the homeless/ marginalised groups these could seem very daunting. Also find it interesting that they were very commodified and had a big long list of restrictions (photography included)? Any thoughts/ little back and forth encouraged :)

Between the superblocks implemented in Barcelona and the general planning of Amsterdam. Which do you think is a better urban planning system?

I'm currently looking at planning a new segregated bike lane, I would like it to replace an existing lane, and also where the chevrons are. 

Currently, vehicles wanting to continue on the R138 from the bottom of the picture have to drive alongside the opposite lane of the traffic (in a contraflow arrangement) before running alongside the other lane in their direction.

However, where I want to put the new bike lane, it collides with the already existing on going traffic.

What measures should I put in place here?

I thought about putting traffic lights for the cyclists where the red lines are but I do not know if they would function in practice.

Please give your suggestions. Thanks :)

Gotta give many towns across the U.S. and Canada credit for these little walkable communities popping up. This particular one is outside of Hamilton, ON (approximately an hour from Toronto). Grimsby has its old walkable town, but what surrounds that is your typical car dependent development. 

This new neighbourhood they built isn’t perfect as public transit is virtually non-existent, still fairly car dependent as a lot of services are outside this section, that bike lane could use some work (although it’s more passible here because it’s a 2 lane road as opposed to a 4-6 lane stroad), and at the time of these photos, was still a work in progress so the commercial section wasn’t complete. Still, it has a main street, quality looking street scape, mix of housing options (low-mid rise condo building and townhomes with parking at the back and low front setbacks), green space adjacent and all-in-all designed to a human scale.



I’m planning on studying abroad in the this fall (my senior year first semester), and am torn between studying in these two cities. The urban planning/sustainable design programs are pretty similar, I think the Copenhagen one is slightly better. Does anyone have any thoughts on the two.
Hi all, I am doing this science/ Engineering challenge, where I have to create new routes from pre-existing routes to link towns over natural features such as hills and rivers to satisfy certain scenarios. The least travelling distance the better, the more towns I link the better.   
However, I have no clue how to do this or what method to approach it. It is basically the travelling salesmen problem but without the coding/ complicated maths.  So my question it, how do I do this?




Okay so I been thinking about this for a bit, but what if we came together as a community and just made a open sourced building and regulations code, have everyone pitch ideas and a team of mods can copy and edit then into 1 big Google Doc. And have it be a way for towns to easily have a code for building walkable cities!   


what do you all think?
How do we address the fact that you cant afford to live in walkable neighborhoods. NYC, Tokyo, London and Paris are all walkable and urbanist utopia, but an average person can never afford it. Even less so if you have a family.

EDIT: a city's affordability isnt determined when you compare it to your US salary and US dollar, you have to look at local salary.



In some places with a rather harsh climate, an overground metro is considered a hassle because they could easily stop on a bad day... which got me wondering: why don't they just build covers to keep the service running?

I mean, it's still probably way cheaper than tunneling an underground metro right?

recently we have had several teenagers get killed by cars in the community. I will write a letter to my town with a list of reasons why bike lanes are a good idea and the following illustration. any recommendations on the illustration or the idea of writing to the town in general?

 \*\*\*\*\*The crossings would slant down toward street level with a slight elevation, and the difference in material would slightly slow down incoming motorists\*\*\*\*\*

I feel like a lot of transit lines that run parallel to each other have a difficulty in being connected with each other.

Is this a shortcoming of a gridiron plan city, which is popular for new cities?


Who built the block buildings of Paris or Barcelona or Europe in general? 

Did the government build them? Or wealthy landowners? 

Were they all planned or did they emerge from a plan or no plan at all?

For the shared-wall buildings of Amsterdam, were people convinced to build them like that? Or were they forced? Or they just wanted to?

Are there any resources on this question? I would happily read them.

I'm currently looking for urban planning jobs in The Netherlands and most of them require an Urban Design portfolio. I had a background in GIS and I am currently teaching myself sketch up and blender but I was wondering what kind of designs I should work on and include in a portfolio. I'm interested in environmental urban planning but open to any kind of work.  Any recommendations would be helpful!
Hi!! Does anybody have a PDF/ e copy of this book?
I'm a student of architecture and we have a seminar tomorrow with the author of this book and I am curious about the same. Would really be grateful if someone can help me find this book.



I've chosen my thesis topic to be the redesigning of an abandoned granite quarry in Kerala, India.
I've identified this to be a social problem in our State as we have deaths happening in and across the state and the country too due to people falling in the quarry or due to the waterbodies formed in the quarry. 
I decided to incorporate landscape and a cultural center by emphasizing a geological museum in this site as I'm living in the cultural capital of Kerala and we don't have any cultural center here.
Also there are very few museums in our country that are dedicated only to geology. This aspect would be the rehabilitation of the quarry site.
The East of the site is thickly vegetated which is why I want to restore the lost vegetation in the site.
I was thinking of conducting surveys by asking the locals of the site and knowing what other problems the people face due to the quarry and what kind of spaces they might want to incorporate there as well.
This concept is new in our country and there are no built projects in a quarry. I'm depending on the built case studies in China which is a hotel that is designed in an abandoned quarry.
Site I have chosen- it has an open pit quarry is around 8375 square meters. I would also consider using the whole pit for one building and consider other buildings to be built on land without considering the contour. The site periphery is large and can be extended up to 61 acre or 2,50,000 sqm. I'm considering only a small bit of land of the whole. The total area including the quarry should be less than 15000 sqm or less than 3.7 acre or 4 acre.
if anybody has some sort of idea that you think it would be appropriate in this site context alongside the geological museum, please share!


How do cities and countries actually do big projects, like is there a bullet train factory in Japan? Does Singapore manufacture its own railways? Can less industrialized countries do that too? Or should they purchase all the components of big projects from countries that can manufacture them?
I’m curious if there are any resources / books / information on different types of parks for urban environments.   The parks in my community primarily consist of large open grass fields with a few pieces of playground equipment in one corner. 

I’m trying to envision how to reimagine some  neighbourhood parks throughout the community to transform these under utilized spaces into something more unique and multi-generational.  Perhaps some could have gardens, some have larger built out environments (concrete pathways, shelters), some could become less manicured and more naturalized.   

Any ideas / photos / designs / inspiration would be welcome!!

It’s not hard to notice that most new urban developments with retail tend to only cater to higher-rent uses such as chain-stores and restaurants.

But there is a huge market out there that is extremely neglected except for in the suburban market. That is, low-rent retail spaces for smaller businesses like you find in suburban strip malls.

Americans who visit Europe may find cities with blocks of ground floor retail, and a large amount of that retail tends to be smaller, locally-owned businesses and not chains or corporations.

Can new urban developments help fill this gap? Our urban areas need to also provide space for smaller, cheaper retail.

Example Uses: antique shops, nail salons, bakeries, dry cleaners, laundromats, small pharmacies, payday loan, psychologists, Optometrists, CPAs, dive bars, pizzerias, pet clinics, small law firms, tattoo parlors, used bookstores, barber shops, dollar stores, tanning salons, dance studios, mini marts, thrift stores, small ethnic restaurants, family dentistries, liquor and smoke stores.

Most of what we see these days are developers going after chain stores and big companies so they can get better rent. 

Is it even possible for developers to cater to these other businesses in urban developments? Or does the cheaper land values in the suburbs make it more feasible than urban locations? Are there ways to encourage or achieve more development that provides this kind of rental space in our cities?



Can I become an Urban Designer with an accredited architecture degree? I am considering a masters in Urban Design but I dont see the same sort of rigorous licensure requirements that you see on the Architecture track. Is there an Urban Design equivalent of AIA?

I’m looking for pointers to organisations and academics who have developed comprehensive evaluation matrices for economic analysis and social indicators including health, ultimately to package funding opportunities for areas in need of investment. Any suggestions would be really appreciated! Thanks so much

Assuming your city or town has spider web /spaghetti layout of roads, is walkability possible with several adjustments over time?

I've been reading Strong Towns by Charles Marohn and been posting to a new reading app called [CommonPlace](https://apple.co/3XHpvHA). It's been very useful to save my favorite reading notes and add personal annotations. What are people thoughts on the excerpt below? 

>*There is a ratio of improvement value to land value that is stable. If that ratio gets too low -* ***a situation where the land is valuable compared to the improvement on it redevelopment pressure increases.*** ***A cheap improvement on an expensive piece of land is a prime candidate for redevelopment.*** *Someone is likely to buy the property, demolish the existing structures, and build something new, something of higher intensity that would more closely justify the higher land value. An expensive improvement on a cheap piece of land is likely to raise the value of the land, not just on the site of the improvement but on neighboring properties. This is especially true if the improvement is built in such a way that it complements surrounding properties.*  
>  
>*These two realities rising land prices inducing redevelopment, redevelopment increasing land values - work together in an incremental framework of development to create a natural renewal mechanism within a neighborhood.*

**This seems intuitive and makes sense, have people seen things that cut against this principle in the real world?** I'm sure there is more nuance out there and he's simplified it for the book so interested to hear people's experiences in local government, development, etc. 

I have read this excerpt and can't stop thinking about gentrification. **Is gentrification simply land that is relatively valuable to the structures / buildings in the area?** Why would land in Brooklyn only recently increase in value relative to the structures? It seems as though the structures were at one point new, and in that point in time the ratio of land to improvement was stable. But then, over time, the structure became less valued relative to the land itself (redevelopment pressure increases).  Is it this simple? Cultural shifts, like preference for urban life over suburban living, also play a role but this framework is good for an elementary understanding of development.

Hi! As the title says, i have to make a video for university where i show how, via tactical urbanism, i can make a square in my city much more lively and livable. I was looking for some videos to start my research, but i can't think of anything + youtube doesn't really help with that. Soo, do you know any videos where people encourage acts of tactical urbanism in their city or anything like it?
For those who like to study urban design, Spartanburg is a fascinating case. It has been picking up steam since 2018 in a very visible way, and is set to explode this 2023. Here are some major projects in the pipeline for its downtown, and it's not even exhaustive! For more, go to www.Facebook.com/GoSpartanburg

Are there solutions here for cleaner water to consumers?
In the 70s Walt Disney bought a bunch of plots of land next to eachother in Orlando and essentially crafted a new urbanist utopia by himself. Why do the uber rich not do this anymore? There's still vast amounts of empty land in the country. There's a lot of dying small towns where the government is really weak or non-existent. For a couple billion dollars, Musk or Zuckerberg or Bezos could revitalize an upstate New York small town complete with a custom ferry network that connects Toronto to great lakes USA. They could buy thousands of acres of farmland in Wyoming and Arizona and build a cyberpunk city. These are the types of projects that would generate a legacy more than another yacht or mega mansion.




Hello all! I am newly in the community development and urban design field of work and have been struggling to find any literature about either subject in general, mixing urban and green spaces, innovative housing, etc. I would appreciate any and all resources (especially books or podcasts) that anyone can think of! Thank y'all





The other day, I was reading through articles discussing how to minimize carbon emissions from construction, and one of the articles I read said that designing streets based on a “capillary web” design would help to reduce carbon emissions. The issue is, I looked up what [the article in question](https://www.chathamhouse.org/2018/06/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete-0/4-disruption-built) meant by that, and got nothing conclusive.




In my 4th topic where I discuss differences between cultural life in my home country Croatia and North America, I'd like to spread few things I noticed about differences between urban planning of the settlements in North America and Eastern Europe and this time I'll be focusing the most on the throughfares in a built environment, or simply - streets.

For the better understanding of the following, let's beggin with differences of settlement definitions in America and Europe:

1. What is city? - in both North America and Europe, city is obviously some very large, significantly populuos, well-known and regarding many things important town (such as Split, Croatia or Montreal, Canada).
2. What is town? - pretty much in both NA nad Europe, town is decently populated area with fixed boundaries and a local government
3. Other settlements - Regarding settlements which are neither towns or cities, the term "village" is rarely used in NA but very well used in Europe - it is something that would be equal to terms "unincorporated community" (term which doesn't exist in Eastern Europe), municipality (single administrative divison having corporate status and powers of self-government) or in some cases even "town" in North America. Population of village could range from few hundred to few thousand and villages are often located in rural areas. Regarding Croatia, villages are usually parts of a certain municipality or a town - for example, village of Pila (population 175) is a part of municipality Stubicke Toplice (population 2, 800), while the village of Matenci (population 473) is a part of town Donja Stubica (population 5,000).

Unlike, Europe, the vast majority of non-city/town settlements across NA were built planned and grew rapidly. Regarding streets, in the most parts of US and Canada, we can usually see three main styles of human settlements - settlements with grid street plan (plan where streets run at right angles to each other), settlements with cul de sac street plan (street plan which includes dead-end streets with a circular ends, we find them mostly in suburbian districts/neighbourhoods) and some kind of mix of the previous two styles. The exception for the mentioned would be some parts of North America such as certain areas of North-Western US states like Massachusetts, Vermont or Maine, which have the most cultural/environmental resemblences to Europe and therefore many street plans which remind us of European ones. 

But for now, let's focus more on the rest of North American continent. Bellow we can see town Saint Remi in the Canadian province of Quebec (population 8,000). We can see that this small town is entirely made of streets which follow both grid and, to a lesser extent, cul de sac plan:

https://preview.redd.it/lgicf8m0b8aa1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1e3df981f84d2b5d83b2dc8cbf3ab51dfd46ddd

In the next satellite view, we can se Champfleury, district of Laval, Quebec (city which represents the largest suburb of Montreal) - we can see that streets in this very settlement were built predominantly using cul de sac plan:

https://preview.redd.it/g1778ed1c8aa1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a814f17d3c84abf2962a9ae951923181134f33c

Now, let's go to Croatia. Like it is the case in many towns across Europe, there are indeed some settlements which follow grid plan in Croatia, but they are mostly limited to either a) historic cores of the largest cities (it is no wonder, since grid plan was actually found in ancient Roman Empire, thousands of years before America was discovered) and b) town or municipality districts which were built in relatively modern era, with car in mind.

Bellow we san see satellite view of the streets in Downtown Zagreb, most of which follow grid plan for centuries:

https://preview.redd.it/k2iylqmlk8aa1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=01390c42ed1b1536a1e803d7dd18854e482f9336

On the next picture, we can se satellite view of the relatively new small suburban district of Varazdin, Croatia (located in the middle of the picture), made up of low-rise appartment buildings, mostly built during 2000's and 2010's. We can see that streets in this appartment block also follow grid plan:

https://preview.redd.it/fgu24oqol8aa1.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7ac6a9e5dcd2681f6d08f88d8e9449159945473

Almost all streets in the settlements which don't fit in the two mentioned categories (mostly smaller towns, villages or municipalities) were developed more "naturally" than in North America - meaning that something which was, for instance, path historically used by pedestrians or animal-hauled carriages, was later expanded/reconstructed/paved and converted into a modern-day street which can be used by cars. Unlike USA and Canada (where, despite of vast areas of fertile farm land and endless ranches,  around 80% of inhabitants live in city areas), Croatia (and South-East Europe in general) is way less urbanized, meaning that plenty of land around streets and densely populated areas is cultivated for centuries - therefore many big or small land-owners refused to hand their lands over for infrastructure improvements. Precisely for this reason, many local roads in Croatia and in the rest of Europe can be very narrow and stretch in irregular corridors, even in such areas as town districts and flat-terrain settlements.

Bellow we can see satellite view of Prelog, town in Medjimurje County, Northern Croatia - we can see most of the streets in this town follow relatively irregular corridors, despite the town itself is positioned exclusively on the flat terrain:

https://preview.redd.it/4kmdhfdmm8aa1.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cd29c602fec3f6063347e41ed4b50deccb30db2

Speaking of cul de sac plan, there are many steets which fade into dead end in Croatia, but cul de sac with a circular end as a type of the street planning is either unexistent or at least not intentionally built  in this part of Europe.
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Pittsburgh, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 min. 23% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 minutes, while 33% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day.


Hi.
So I'm currently looking to get a Masters Degree in Urban Planning and Architecture. I feel very intrigued and interested in the field. Currently, I'm working in a construction management firm and it's been over a year since I've been in that role. Is there some way I can do Masters in Urban Planning?
Thanks! Waiting anxiously for a response.

I'm trying to make a a 2D design for a 4 lane street to be converted into a 2 lane with a road diet and bikelanes (with cement separation). I'd love to be able to use it to show my local government so they might petition It. 

But I really don't have the capability to make a drawing either by hand or in a Computer. Any help with that will be a blessing, thanks.

I will note that is an assumption that business that are targeting local communities directly, like office, tend to be at the center of cities. If my assumption is true, why is that the case? In my mind, I wondered if that lead to a lack of diverse communities and possibly reinforcing relining (I look up racist urban design, but I was trying to find the term for what lead to good and bad neighborhood). Where it allows for the possibility to created their closed off communities b/c the abundance of space away from the city center. 

&#x200B;

Or is it more of big business are able to put money into a single location allowing it to develop more in what we see now? And that the divided communities we see on the outside of our current city centers is a product of the lack of investments?

&#x200B;

Or it is something else? I was just curious to hear what people with probably more knowledge then me. I'm gotten quite curious about what it takes to make more walkable cities. The more you pull on a tread, the more connected pieces it makes me wonder about. I'm also going to be moving to a new city, so I want to try to figure out what I could do as an individual to help local initiative to make people happier without needing to depend on a 2 ton asset that only depreciates in value and comes with it's own maintenance fees.









 Hi all,

We all have that one urban design project that really stands out in our minds - the one that made us think, "Wow, that's really cool!"

So, what's your favorite urban design project? Share a picture or a few details in the comments below and let's discuss!










Had a conversation with some friends yesterday about cheap places to hang out over winter break that aren't our houses. We started listing a few: the library, the mall... but drew a blank pretty fast. We're underage so bars are obviously a no. In the summer parks are an option but its like negative 10 right now. What's up with the lack of third places for teens?? Does anyone have any suggestions?

Hello! I’m doing masters in urban design in the UK. I have worked as an architect for 1 year earlier and went on to do my masters. So relatively new with urban design, hence applying for a graduate role. 

When does the job posting close for a graduate urban designer role considering that my semester so far has only had urban analysis but not urban design yet which is only happening in the next semester. I worry it might be too late by the time I wait for me to put my urban design work considering that the companies right now are also asking for a portfolio. I also see few job listings closing their graduate openings by the end of December and already had missed few that closed 30th November. I’m confused and need some guidance please.


Hello, I am a high school student that has chosen to work on a project that heavily involves 3D design and urban planning, where I have to create a city that fits a certain list of criteria that I set for myself. My product goal is to construct a 3D digital city plan with multiple economic access points and an emphasis on infrastructures as well as community-oriented design. My city plan will attempt to deal with many of the issues observed in cities nowadays through the creation of more opportunities for affordable housing, better organized roads to avoid congestion, walkable areas and the creation of communal space to improve social well-being.

So far I have been working on figuring out the technical part of the design (ie use of 3D rendering software) but I've hit somewhat of a roadblock in doing research for the planning as I am a bit lost and don't know where to start or what basics to understand. So I came to this subreddit for some pointers on where to start or what kinds of trends to examine and incorporate into my design. Thank you for any help I can get.

(Note that this is somewhat of a small project and I am new to this kind of work. Information or tips related to software such as sketchup is also welcome)

I am a high school student in Denmark. I have an assignment where I talk about urban planning, and here I talk about Houston and Amsterdam. I need help with finding a map of land use and zoning. I know that Houston is famous for not having zoning but I was wondering if there was a map that showed it anyway. the same for Amsterdam

It could really help me work I have been stuck

Hi everybody,

I\`m creating a map of Munich altstadt and I want to show some specific paths´ surface material (like asphalt, cobblestone etc.). While doing this, I should have the georeference also. Do you have any suggestion like a program or platform to create my map? I considered using mapbox or illustrator with mapublisher plug-in. To be honest, none of these options seem me convenient enough. Because making the map in illustrator would definitely take so much time. For mapbox, I consider the level of flexibility I can have. I think it can kind of limit me. Thanks for all of your answers.

 Hi, 

I'm an Australian Economics student writing a paper on the effect of public transportation on businesses' operational sustainability. As a part of this, I need to know roughly how public transport affects people's choices regarding businesses as a part of urban design and city planning.  


Please answer the following questions to the best of your ability and assume that public transportation is **high quality, sanitary and reliable** in these scenarios.

Thank you!





**TLDR: I gud at computers, I likey urban design, pls halp apply me degree to it for gud future.**

I'm a 24-year-old, 2nd year CS Student who has up until recently been wandering through life listlessly. I have had a high-degree of programming and logical skill and enjoyed the utilization of those skills, throughout my childhood, but nothing invites me passion that I could put that skill into. Furthermore, while I have a number of hobbies, none can be spun into a career that caters to my skill set (Game Development is a worker ethics rat's nest). My efforts are likely to land me a networking job at a generic nameless insurance company.

Growing up in a small Canadian town, non-sustainable car-oriented Urban Development is an issue that's plagued me throughout my life: but I never quite understood what I was annoyed by. That "feeling" often went away in my families travel throughout the world in my childhood.

I learned why, after I stumbled upon a "Not Just Bikes" video this year; it started me down a rabbit-hole to understanding some of the issues in North American urban development. I have never consumed as many academic papers, and news articles for any issue apart from this, and it's invited a lot of passion in me that I never knew I had. But, as much as I long for the efficient and beautiful streets of Amsterdam; moving away from Canada, is something that doesn't interest me either. My family, from my aging parents, to my 3 siblings, many cousins, and nephews/nieces all live here, and I love... just being a Canadian.

I want to be part of the movement to change North American urban design and infrastructure. I have had heated (but friendly) debates with my car-centric parents, have become a bike commuter, my views on public transit have changed, I have even taken interest in transit development in my own city to the point of attending council meetings, and... well have spent a lot of time procrastinating exam studying (like right now), being a keyboard warrior.

Especially with the momentum building in North America, I want to help further this cause, using the best tools in my arsenal. However, I'm in the same situation as my hobbies... none of this caters to my skill set. I'm not an urban planner. My ability to pull memory addresses using GDB, doesn't help me productively engage NIMBY's, draw-out a connected LRT stop, or envision the design of a thriving pedestrian park. Just about the only shared skill I can think of is analytical based.

**So, along with adding a minor in Community Design (which I plan on talking to my Academic advisor about); what are some unique and novel careers I could pursue that I could apply towards this field (beyond boring and routine obvious stuff like maintaining servers, programming traffic lights, etc)?**

I'm doing a term paper for a planning grad school course that proposes a Garden City styled system of regional growth for the Hudson Valley region of New York, but I can't find any examples at present of the planning system helping to curtail sprawl in its served communities, and promote internal densification and redevelopment. What would your recommendations be for a case study?

Hi all, I was talking with my brother-in-law about urbanism and public transportation and the like, but his main sticking point was that he believes that high population density necessary devolves social cohesion and thus causes more crime as "People just wouldn't know their neighbors." I tried looking this up, but the things I found were either not very good or super dense and impossible for me to understand. Thus, does anyone have any good resources (especially peer-reviewed stuff as he would be much more likely to be convinced by that) that talk about this?







I'm wanting to be an urban designer. I intend on applying for my masters for it next year (coming from a 'sort of' L.Arch+Urbanism degree) and right now I work as a Junior Planner in the private sector in Canada. My problem is, I'm not sure where my interests are taking me within the realm of urban design, or if what I'm thinking career-wise technically falls in the realm of it??

I've always held great interest in sustainable development, but then also a bit in the greater regional policies realm, now urban mobility, economic development (if circular economies count in that?), placemaking...too many interests! I want to be a consultant probably, or do I need to go government...but I want to do big picture design, some detail design, long term urban strategization...

To cap it off, lately I've been considering going for a 1 yr MSc. in sustainable urban development, or stratrgic urban policies and management?? Double it with a M.UD??

I don't know what I'm describing, what my niche is. I have no mentors here because: A) I know I need to leave my city to make this career (I don't like being here anyways) and no one here really cares to leave, and B) no one's career path or goals/ideas is anything like what I'm describing, and most don't understand why I want to leave anyways

...I'm just lost. I'm not sure where I'm going and for what, not sure what to do next, not sure if what I'm expecting for a career is plausible...whatever it is??

 Please, if you have resources or tips or can point me to someone/something that can help sort out whatever the hell I'm talking about, let me know.



If you have ideas or problems with the subreddit, don't hesitate to write about that just below in the comments, will take a look and potentially try to find ways to add your idea(s)/fix your problem(s).

Context: I'm in my early 30s with 6+ years experience,  living in Australia and currently practising in UD greenfield sector here. I've lived most of my life here, and while I am paid well and my job is moderately interesting - fundamentally I'm bored and would rather go live and work overseas.

I've actively applied for jobs in Singapore, London and Toronto in the last few years however Covid seriously impacted my ability get anywhere meaningful with these applications, plus my level of experience seemed to weaken my prospects.

Ideally my next destination is:

- A big vibrant city
- Decent pay
- Career progression and opprortunity
- Interesting work

Singapore seems like the only city that hits the majority of the above points (I'm sure Hong Kong was also prior to the government crackdown), London wages would be maybe 20% less than what I earn here. Toronto is a big city but it doesn't have the same global footprint like the others.

Where would you do if you were in my position? (Including places I have not specifically mentioned) Do any urban designers in here happen to have any interesting roles going in their firms?
I'm an architecture student, and my current semester is based on urban design/acupuncture. My site is a CBD, with two urban villages and slums, along with an upscale neighborhood, in its immediate vicinity, and I'm kind of at a loss at the moment because even after talking to so many people there, and doing surveys, all I've found out is that nobody has any issues and everybody is very happy and well-off. The slums aren't really slums anymore either, in fact, I felt good walking through the area.

I've been thinking of designing a solution along the lines of ecology+improving the imageability of the urban villages (I was thinking social cohesion w the more upper-class population, but in a way that also benefits the residents of these villages/slums - but it feels like there's nothing I could do that would benefit them any further). But I really don't know what exactly to propose, what exactly am I supposed to give a solution to? This feels like a very stupid rant.

Hello,

I am seeking general career advice from people that work in the field of urban design, architecture, urban planning.

I graduated college in 2018 with a degree in computer science, and since then have been steadily employed in the government sphere of tech with a fairly strong salary and career prospects. I've earned many IT certs which help my employability but also, hopefully, show that I am very dedicated to learning and self-paced exams.

Since COVID I have become extremely interested in urban design. Pretty much start with NotJustBikes, /r/fuckcars, and the hundreds of related subreddits, forums, youtube creators, etc., that make up this area. I have read every book that CityBeautiful has suggested, I've read all the books that Chuck Marohn wrote, and all the content from StrongTowns, I've read (if I had to guess), more books on urban design, walkability, transit, and architecture in the last two years than most people who post on these forums. With my remote job, I've been travelling around the country exploring different cities and checking out different projects (Atlanta's Belt Line, Philly's Rail Park, etc.), and walking and cycling everywhere, every day. I have surrendered my car entirely and get around only by bike, transit, or walking, now. This movement has become exceptionally important to me.

I've helped some local parks with graphic design work, or modifying the colors/grades on Google Maps to reflect changes, but I am looking for more. While I enjoy the freedom and the salary that a credentialed tech job gets me in the US, I am certainly not fulfilled creatively, and I feel like I lack a collaborative environment. In short, at the medium-to-higher levels of DevOps, you're essentially just babysitting vendor products from AWS or Azure. My true passion seems to lie in transit, zoning, walkability, bikeability, etc.

I've been lurking this sub, /r/architecture, and some other more career-focused subs to figure out what might be the best step for me, and I am curious what you all would suggest. I am currently about to enroll in a 2 year masters degree in literature (for literally no reason except that I like lit - you do not need a masters for any technical IT job and I do not want to work in AI, nor do I want an MBA and to be an executive). There seems to be very little overlap between urban design and high-level cloud-based IT.

So here's what I've determined to be my options.

1.) Attend an online/hybrid 2-yr masters degree in urban planning from an online school, take a massive pay cut and work for some city, starting from the bottom. Do I need an urban planner bachelors degree too? I can't find a straight answer (maybe its obvious), but in IT, one can get an IT masters with any type of bachelors, and commonly you meet coworkers with bachelors degrees in russian lit, or biology, or something else completely unrelated.

2.) same thing above but with Urban Design instead of urban planning.

3.) Join more urbanist groups and attend weekly meetings and just argue for or against measures as they come, forever (what I currently do), and post a lot on reddit and other forums.

4.) Go back to school and obtain a bachelors degree in Civil Engineering. This feels like an immense step back because I'm 26 and am in a job that I could reasonably stick with forever. But its just not what I want out of like. (I started a company in 2019 for CAD modeling for 3D printers that has some success and I would say I am a fairly advanced user of my particular CAD software and I see no reason why I couldn't take those self-taught skills to a degree that also uses them.

5.) Attempt to enter local politics as a mid-twenties guy and vote for bike lane infrastructure as it comes.

6.) Take community college courses that are urban-design-adjacent until I can reasonably build up a transcript that shows I am serious. Unfortunately my local CC does not offer any urban design/engineering stuff.

I am feeling very aimless. I just need general advice on what avenue would make the most difference, or allow the most creative input from myself. I am currently only able to satisfy this need by helping out small local "friends of the \_\_\_\_ park" groups, which are typically comprised entirely of octogenarians that simply want, like, a parking lot to not happen. This is fine but its far too slow moving for me.

Any advice is appreciated and sorry for the thousand word bitch essay lol.

Hello,

I'm considering going to grad school to pursue a Master's in Urban Design and could use some feedback on the design quality of this passion project of mine. I plan to add additional graphics (create a site plan, add callouts, etc.), but I would like to hear from folks in the architecture and planning industry. I'll also throw a poll in here to figure out whether it's portfolio-worthy or not.

I'm currently in high school, and urban design is something that I'm pretty passionate about, and would love to make my profession as an adult. However I'm kind of worried about the environments of urban design jobs. While I obviously don't know, it seems like something that could have a very "corporate" feel. Which I don't love. I know it's a fairly broad field, so i could see how it could vary from job to job, and I've learned a bit about the difference in public and private work. So I have two questions, 1 being am I right? 2 being, if I am at least somewhat right, do you as an urban designer (or something similar) still enjoy the job even with the not so enjoyable part? Thanks :)

As I live in an Latin America country, happens that most of the literature available about urban planning or urban design comes from north american or europeans authors, and as it becomes the mainstream, we don't have contact with the kinds of thinking about urban planning in other parts of the world. So, Would like to ask you guys some indications about what to read from authors from contries such China, India, Russia, Iran, Indonesia, Phillipines, for exemple, and about african writers, other latin america contries, mid-eastern contries and so on. Basically, everithing out of the "west", wich inclues, basicaly, anglosaxon contries plus europe.



For example, Denver, CO voted to create a tax to fix and regulate sidewalks and build a masterplan sidewalk network.

I know not everyone on this sub is American, so please delete if not allowed. I would just like to see some good news, since we know urban design in American cities is not the friendliest.
>Only thing I don’t love about CuldeSac is they plan to be 100% rental facilities. There is no plan for them to ever do a development where you can buy a unit.

>They literally have to do this, as most cities are so crazy about zoning that new urbanist typically fail. You can kind of skate these regulations by saying no no this is an apartment complex.

>That's interesting. It would be illegal to sell them as condos or something?
What is the difference between a rentable apartment and sellable condo wrt zoning?

I posted https://youtu.be/9nWD65PI_i0 on another sub, and someone asked this question. I thought it had to do with zoning, but wanted to know if there was another reason for this.

Culdesac Tempe, in Tempe, AZ, USA, is a mixed commercial and apartment complex. That they are considering a “neighbourhood.” Is there a reason this had to be an apartment instead of townhouse complex or condo complex?

For a class that I am teaching, I’m looking for examples from urban design and architecture where residents or other users meaningfully contributed to the final design.  For example, when we built our farmers market we sat down with local farmers to make sure that the building met their needs. As a result of these meetings, we added doors and made other changes.  Are you familiar with any specific examples that I could show?
Currently want to see new park let’s cropped up in my local neighborhood to replace a few parking spots. However I don’t know the best way to contact my local planning department. Would I just email them with my idea or would I have to do something else?

Planning Department in question: San Francisco Planning Department

Hi folks,

I have a bachelor's degree in urban planning and am considering a master's in urban design. I graduated in 2012 and worked for a small boutique planning firm, only to find that the work was largely policy/zoning-focused and not very creative. I tried looking for a more creative position, but after scouring through various job listings and landing interviews (but no offers), I gave up that pursuit and decided to pursue different jobs. I'm 34 and would love to jump back into the industry. I work in insurance, and while the company I work for treats me very well, I find the work unfulfilling. While I recognize that, at the end of the day, survival is more important than "doing what you love," I'd hate to ask myself in my older years why I never followed my dreams.

My bachelor's degree was from a Midwestern school with a physical planning/urban design emphasis. The economy cratered back in 08/09, and with that, many design opportunities. So I never really got the chance to work in a professional studio environment and develop the portfolio and professional connections that would land me design-focused jobs. I have been scouring the internet for online portfolios to get caught up on the latest planning/design trends. I've also done some 3D modeling of streetscapes in SketchUp during my free time.

My main concerns are:

1. Urban design, while intriguing, seems like a very niche field. Would an architecture master's open more doors for me?
2. For those of you who did pursue a master's in urban design, how was the job hunt? How far did you have to move to land your first gig? Are you enjoying it so far?
3. Did your master's program offer you any grant money or teaching assistantships?

I'm happy to DM people my undergrad portfolio...granted, it's pretty old! It contains information that would give away my identity, so I'd rather not share it here.

Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated!

I’m actually a French student in urban planning, I would like to work in the United States later, so maybe your answers could help me into finding a place to settle down. Thank you and sorry for my bad English

It is my thought that there should be NO more single story only buildings within any commercial or R2, R3 areas.  Simple.  Every building needs to go vertically to increase density.  We are going to experience many many more people. Mixed use buildings and urban villages have great potential benefits. 

Thank you.
To explain further: 

- the challenge I’m facing is that the city I’m working on is restricted from all around, so expanding into more lands isn’t possible 
It’s a mix of political restrictions (that I won’t get into) and topographical (surrounded by a natural park and green mountains)

- the city itself has high building density so we are trying to move into the outskirts ( they are classified as rural housing areas and have large pieces of land) 

I’m still a student and this challenge is different to all my classmates and I was thinking to ask for pointers towards what kind of approach we should use, or what is this case can be compared to
Do it!  I mean make your crosswalks unique, fun, and artistic.  Have murals painted in the streets.  
 Why?  Local art, flavor on the hard surfaces which pedestrians only typically occupy in a mild state of anxiety, as a more inviting place.   Cultural references and unique hardscape features tie us emotionally to our locations.  These inexpensive features give identity and beauty to an otherwise bland landscape.
  I have literally heard a city planner cited ADA codes as a reason that crosswalks all had to be the same.  Meanwhile, Seattle is just 38 miles away and has rainbows and geodesic shapes on its crosswalks.  I have seen several blocks changed, existentially improved, in Portland when a single large sunflower was painted in a residential neighborhood.  The power for important psychological and traffic changes is strong.  City planners, who are stuck in a mindset of costs vs flow vs taxes, will resist creativity, will resist anything that does not exactly fit in the manual of street design.




I'm a fresh graduate with a BA in Urban Planning and am interested in communications and digital design for planning and design work such as advocacy and public relations for planning projects and initiatives/campaigns. Is there a career route in this with a background in planning? What jobs or opportunities are there for this career?

Imagine you are given a wand that will let you play cities skylines / sim city with the limitation being you’d have to fix an already existing cities urban planning issues and remake it in your image

1.) what location do you choose?

2.) how do you redesign the city? 

I’d take the city of Cleveland Ohio. I’d erase the airport on the waterfront, and redevelop it into a park. In fact, I’d make the whole waterfront like how Chicago and Milwaukee’s are.  

Next- disappear the highways and parking lots choking downtown. Replace with brick buildings that fit in with the historic architecture.

Third- make canals that flow from the lake and and the river. Male Cleveland a canal city inspired by Amsterdam or St Petersburg.

Fourth- expand the RTA Lines- both light rail and heavy rail. Make a purple line that goes south, and a yellow line that is the loop line that connects all the ends.

Fifth- I’d make heavy tax incentives so that potential future residents would want to invest in developing the run down areas.

Now it’s your turn. What city would you choose to redevelop, and how would you do it?
Who are the better urban designers who have a flair for large scale rural design at a regional level?   Looking for the design teams that do the best work in rural areas which will see near-future growth.

Imagine multiple adjacent counties poised for extensive growth over the next 5 to 10 years, and there is pending need for planning that growth in the best possible way.  

Bonus for the designers that are experienced within the Southeastern United States. 

Bonus bonus for the designers that think outside the box instead of the same old, same old.

Bonus bonus bonus for the designers that are experienced with carbon-neutral development (which really they all should be, but some do it better than others). 

Thank you.

3. 2-way, 2-lane street with 90° parking and buffered 2-way bike lane. (This one is my personal favorite)

I have been trying to do r/bikecommuting, while working from home; however, I literally have to travel across town just to get everything I want. Why is there not a convenience store in every neighbourhood. I don’t care if it’s run by the HOA or is a an accessory commercial unit ran by my neighbour. I want to go to the store to buy beer, this design is dumb how did anyone think this was remotely a good idea.

Were the planners even thinking when they only allowed single-use zoning? Did they think that the design scheme was completely random or something?

My point is a bit ranty, but I’m honestly frustrated that I couldn’t just walk down the street to get some beer and exercise.

EDIT: Apparently, I should continue practicing my French because my English grammar is terrible.



# Overview

I briefly discussed this high-speed rail in [a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbandesign/comments/xwrx95/australia_is_finally_get_a_move_on_highspeed_rail/), however, it seems that when I made that post I was lacking quite a bit of very interesting information. So, I thought I'd dig a bit more and gather more information so you folks (if interested) can get a deeper insight -- so let's get into this new post!

**When was this first proposed?**

Although it's recently come back into the media because of our current PM Anthony Albanese [announcing a major move in making the high-speed rail happen](https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/department/media/news/high-speed-rail-authority-legislation-introduced-parliament), it was actually already planned out with routes, stations, speeds, time and cost estimates all the way back in a 2013 Report, with it later being picked up by Infrastructure Australia in 2017, which I'll be discussing in this post.

**How high-speed is "high-speed"?**

Its speed is proposed at being "exceeding 250kph" with the maximum speed being 350kph and the operational speed varying on the service. Compared to some of the fastest trains in the world it's not really *that* fast, however considering the length of time interstate trains take currently I find myself pretty enthusiastic about the possible travel time reduction (Further details below)

**Where will the HSR go?**

As its name suggests, it is meant to connect cities along the East Coast of Australia, including the capital cities Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane. According to the 2013 report it would feature 1,748 of new tracks connecting the four cities mentioned, as well as 12 regional cities (Further details below).

**How much will it cost?**

According to the 2013 Report, this project would cost up to AUD$114 billion (2012 AUD) which adjusted for inflation is around $139 billion today. *A lot of money, basically.*

# Background

**What are these intercity/interstate rail speeds like today?**

Not, great. Lmao. Right now it currently takes approx. 13-15 hours between Melbourne and Canberra, 4 hours between Canberra and Sydney, then 14 hours between Sydney and Brisbane. A pretty long damn time. Even with intercity trains it's still fairly long, e.g. Sydney to Newcastle is longer than the equivalent car journey at around 2.5 hours.

**What connections is the current interstate rail missing?**

* Direct linkage between Melbourne and Canberra. Although the two are connected by rail, the issue is that because of the design, you cannot take a single train between these two cities. Instead you must change at Goulburn Station where you have to wait up to *3 hours* for the train transfer, which adds to the travel time a lot. This is shown on the map below.

[Trains from Melbourne have to stop at Goulburn because the intersection does not allow turning into Canberra.](https://preview.redd.it/tjohz256qks91.png?width=542&format=png&auto=webp&s=a49332552c8016292112a9f5a36741edf83a162c)

* Direct linkage to the Gold Coast. As a [comment on my previous post mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbandesign/comments/xwrx95/comment/ir8uiza/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), there is currently no existing rail into the Gold Coast, skipping straight into Brisbane which you can imagine is problematic.

[The only existing interstate connection is by Coach, rather than by train.](https://preview.redd.it/vy331mv0rks91.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c64f9de59a6954673ca9c63dc8c32351b76deba)

# The East Coast HSR

**Proposed route & stops + fixed connections!**

As shown on the map below, the East Coast HSR's proposed route is very similar to the already existing interstate rail, however as you can see it now has corrected railways to allow for direct linkages between Melbourne and Canberra, and into the Gold Coast. It has much less stops compared to the full interstate, and perhaps this is simply to accommodate maximising speed of the HSR.

https://preview.redd.it/52iolbjesks91.png?width=533&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dc338106be7a4079eedb1310c0cdf75a559582e

**Journey/travel times + Speed variance**

So as mentioned earlier, the current interstate journeys can be up to 15 hours! So how long would it take (theoretically) under the proposed HSR? Well, according to the 2013 Report it will be cut down to just a few hours, and sometimes not even!

[Estimated journey times for the proposed HSR's Express \(capital-to-capital\) services.](https://preview.redd.it/2aml8dgxsks91.png?width=471&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8b580b8423a38494c0eab952ca5a36dfa289dd6)

The journey and operational speed will depend on whether the service is an Express (capital-to-capital) or Regional (every stop). For Express it will operate at the maximum proposed speeds of 300-350kph, and for Regional it will operate at maximum speeds of 200-250kph.

# So, what's happening? What's the timeframe?

As aforementioned, this proposal goes all the way back to 2013 and has been on hold since. However, in April 2022 the National Faster Rail Agency released a report confirming brand new and billion-dollar investments into the proposal (alongside other railway projects).

The Prime Minister also recently put forward a bill for the establishment of a High-Speed Rail Authority to be an independent agency overlooking the East Coast Rail's future construction. The bill underwent its 1st and 2nd Reading in the House of Representatives on Sept 8th, and the 2nd Reading debate was on Sept 28th. You can check out its progress [here](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6904).

The original 2013 Report projects the completion of the HSR as going into *2065* which is a long-ass time, and as [a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/highspeedrail/comments/xys3n5/comment/irk46f7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) has pointed out, there has been an external study finding that the HSR could be built for cheaper and in under 10 years. You can check out that report [here](https://bze.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/high-speed-rail-bze-report-2014.pdf).

# Overview

In Sydney, where I am a resident of, the NSW Department of Education (DoE) has begun proposals of "vertical schools" due to a growing issue of space. This is rather strange as, at least here, vertical schools are a completely unheard of (as most schools are no more than 2 stories tall).

I was wondering what y'all think of this.

The example I've got here is the proposed **Sydney Olympic Park High School**, *which, oddly enough isn't even being constructed in Sydney Olympic Park (suburb) but rather in Wentworth Point (WWP) on its waterfront*. It is going to be a **6-story** **building** as shown in the diagram below.

[Diagram from NSW School Infrastructure of proposed layout of the school.](https://preview.redd.it/kd921jzbycs91.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e44fc64eda5241fffafe5e748e990b73d151565)

[Another diagram, of the flat proposed layout of the school from NSW Infrastructure.](https://preview.redd.it/on7jyihz3ds91.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=2df1d209e57b204a608ff406961a0ba2a7310143)

The school is intended to **have a capacity of about 1,500** with its target demographics being the populace of the suburbs Wentworth Point, Olympic Park and Concord West, which is extremely necessary because at the moment **these suburbs + at least another 13 suburbs** are being serviced by **just one co-ed high school** (Concord High School). 

[Basically, what I just said, but in the words of NSW School Infrastructure.](https://preview.redd.it/ckh47aln3ds91.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2c3271e15bb575ec1b00c1426fce60c098e5a22)

# There's a catch (at least, apparently).

As mentioned, the school's designated site is in Wentworth Point ... and this has spurred a lot of backlash from pretty much most submissions I've seen to the NSW DoE about it. For context: WWP is a small suburb, in fact it's just 0.6 km^(2) (0.2 mi^(2)), and it is a densely packed suburb as is.

It is composed entirely of medium to high-rise buildings, *except for the industrial*, with roads that are thin and with limited surface parking. This is because it is a pedestrian and transport-orientated suburb. And this has caused some alarm in some submissions I've read, like one saying "there's no parking that teachers could use" then "how will students even get into the school?". This might be an overreaction from car users. There's also concerns about the public transportation for students, how it's not reliable or frequent enough (this is pretty true tbf), but it's important to note that every public school like will receive funding to have their own school buses separate from the public network. 

Below is a diagram, *made by yours truly*, showing the local area of the proposed school and its surroundings. Then there's an image of the road which the school is being constructed, for an idea of what the area is like.

I was wondering if anyone knew how much tram tracks cost in a hilly city or any city in general.


Last month, it got announced that legislation to form the "High Speed Rail Authority" was put forward to Parliament, and that Australia will be finally trying to get a move on with building high-speed commuter rail.

In Sydney, where I live, the trains are currently capped at 130km/h, and they usually don't even reach that speed; making them often take DOUBLE the time of a car to get some places, e.g. for me to drive to the Sydney CBD from where I am is 30 mins versus 1 hour for a train.

The Government's first priority is building high speed rail between Sydney and Newcastle (a city up north), which currently has a regular railway which takes around 2.5 hours (slower than a car trip). **The high-speed rail will supposedly go up to 250km/h, cutting that 2.5 hour trip to just 40 minutes**, which might be game-changing! And this is apparently the first-step of a planned Pacific high-speed rail from Melbourne to Brisbane through Sydney.

I just hope the legislation actually gets through Parliament haha!

Hey friends,

So, I read a headline that says ["Canadian kids get 'D' letter grade for overall physical activity in report card"](https://bc.ctvnews.ca/canadian-kids-get-d-letter-grade-for-overall-physical-activity-in-report-card-1.6095274)


I'm curious what design and functionality--beyond bike paths and designated parkland--can lure and help embrace more positive physical activity, movement and space for kids and adults alike to be more active. Are there some innovative or creative projects that have been implemented, in the works or conceptualized?
Wentworth Point's a small and recently new suburb of Sydney. I lived here for a few years, and I thought it's an interesting example of contemporary urban design.

The suburb utilises mixed-use development around different parts of it, implemented as apartment buildings with the bottom floors vacated for commercial area. The sidewalks are decently sized, although at some points along Hill Road (the main road) it just randomly stops, leaving some bus stops with no connecting footpath. 

There are three main bus services that come through: the 526 & 533 (public buses), then the Wentworth Point-Rhodes Shuttlebus (privately-operated by Billbergia, the suburb's main developer). The Shuttlebus is a free-to-use/fareless service that loops between Wentworth Point and the Rhodes railway station (a suburb across) every 10-15 minutes, though it doesn't operate on weekends.

To make the streets more pedestrian and transport-focused, the parking on the streets is pretty limited (both physically and time limit-wise) with the shopping centres placing their carparks underground.

The only direct road connection to Rhodes, the suburb over (which also has the closest train station) is Bennelong Bridge, a T-way bridge with a pedestrian walkway which means only buses, cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians can cross.

Other than that, there's things like the neat community library and centre, public amenities like a gym that's free for residents, but there are still some cons such as poor mobile reception, public bus services not being frequent enough, etc etc. And yeah.

I recently had been investing some time researching the Sydney Tramway network, what it looked like at its maximum extent, and what caused its downfall. If theoretically, Sydney's Tramway network survived, how do you folks think it might've affected the way modern Sydney came to be? [https://transitmap.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tumblr\_o42vuoxfKM1r54c4oo1\_1280.png](https://transitmap.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tumblr_o42vuoxfKM1r54c4oo1_1280.png)


I'm an urban design student and I was asked to find a casestudy about a waterfront project implementation that was a failure. 
Looking for suggestions because I can't find anything.
Poster for a best friend

Hi all, my best friend is really into civil engineering, highways and road design. He will have his birthday soon and I want to make a wall poster for him with a plan/schema of some highway interchange. He knows a lot about it, so I thought it would be great if it’s as close to real plans as possible. Could you help me please and point me in the right direction where can I find such plans?
Or what keywords should I search for? 

I was already thinking to go to local civil engineering school and check their library. Do you think it’s worth the trip?














For the urban designers. What would happen if one day it started raining, and it never stopped?

My town is considering re-designing our Main Street.   It’s a quintessential small-town Main Street, about 6-8 blocks of 2-3 story heritage and newer buildings with retail at street level and apartments / offices above.  The street is a two lane road with parking on both sides.  

If you were designing the street from scratch, what would you include?  What would you avoid?   Pictures / examples would really help.  Thanks!




What I mean is what would a survey that is trying to see how many people would support the pedestrianization of a street look like? 

Would it depend on the street that is getting pedestrianized?
 I'm looking to make a youtube channel focused on my experiences biking around Portland and the infrastructure that could be better but am stumped on a name for it, anyone got a suggestion or something that isn't already used?



I work for a planning department in a small inner-ring suburb. We have recently seen an influx of those "high-tech" modern Car Washes (you know, the ones with a thousand outdoor free vacuums). These car washes all but kill any chance of walkability on our main corridors. In short, I hate them with a passion. 

I'd love to eventually create intense separation buffers to essentially zone these things out of the community. In the meantime, however, does anyone have examples of car wash design standards that can help to better integrate new car washes into an existing urban fabric?







Hi everyone! I wondered if anyone can give me advice on how to successfully switch career paths into urban planning/design? I got my BA in Film in 2019 but before that I had done 3 years of a sustainability BS degree. I am realizing now that I indeed do want to go into the sustainable career sector and specifically in urban planning or design but I’m wondering how I can apply to masters programs when I’m coming from a BA in Film. I’m not sure if I am supposed to maybe volunteer with some organizations before applying or reach out to old professors from my first unfinished degree for letters of rec? I just feel like the latter of those options is a bit too long ago. Any advice or ideas would be appreciated.


 What are the best articles (or best advocates) that support the argument that high density can be achieved with mid-rise, rather than towers in a sea of low density?




I'm a Realtor Associate in Jamaica, an avid player of Sim City and enthusiast in urban planning (hope to also be a land economist and valuation surveyor, broker and urban planning consultant, the first of the market urbanist kind) and I couldn't help but wonder about the Bid Rent Theory applications to different city models.

I've noticed that the concentric zoning model seems to best cater to a town that is more homogenous in terms of the type of industry agglomerated in the area (such as Spanish Town, St. Catherine, which is more of a logistics and retail/wholesale hub) while the multiple nuclei model tends to lend itself to a diversified city (such as Kingston and St. Andrew, which has a mixture of businesses ranging from the financial industry, manufacturing, BPOs, tourism, etc.).

In that case, the incentives would be different, considering that the concentric zoning model has more potential to lend itself to a city with an homogenous industry, then it would be a fixed model where the CBD and commercial zones would have the highest bid prices and rents for land as location is important, especially in a central area of agglomeration where transport costs would be shared, with residential housing being put on the outside, while in the multiple nuclei model, different industries have different tastes (such as financial industries wanting office commercial properties in the CBD, manufacturers wanting it in areas outside the town if they are weight losing industries, etc.). While I'm unsure about the sectoral model of urban structure and its incentives, is it safe to say that the layout of cities create different incentives for individuals and firms to operate and create differing property values and micro markets within a city? Would it also be useful for urban designers, planners and stakeholders understand how urban structure and the Bid Rent Theory influences property values? Also, what ramifications would this simple model have on policy decisions in a 21st Century city and its problems such as housing, transportation, economic resources, etc.?



I finished a master's in urban planning in January and realised while I was doing the degree that my interest lies more in the urban design side of planning but I don't seem to be able to do anything to do with that even though I "specialised" in urban design. I say specialised in air quotes because I feel like I didn't get to do much urban design in my degree even though we had to choose an option and thats what I chose. 

I have asked my work (a local authority in London) if I can do roles which have come up relating to urban design and they keep saying no because I don't have an urban design or architectural background. So does this mean I should do another degree in urban design to get that background? 

I also have an interest in GIS and climate in the context of urban environments so have been wondering if I should bother with the urban design degree and maybe do a qualification which is more specialist related to one those interests instead. This also might help me get a more interesting job as I think I am not interested in giving people planning permission but how cities work on a larger scale than the local level of London Boroughs.  Basically just looking for advice on how I can do something which more suits my interests, do I need to go back to uni?

Can anyone share a copy of  rooftop catalogue? It's not available in my country.


Hey y'all,

I'm doing a trip in late fall to Western Europe where I'll be spending a few days in northern Italy, a few days in southern Germany and and several days in the Netherlands. I absolutely adore trains, infrastructure, and urban design and I'm curious what y'all think are some of most interesting things to see and do in those areas that are related to urban design. I love weirdly designed parks, bridges, and intersections as well as anything related to trams, light rail, and cycling. I am absolutely going to go use the largest underground bike parking garage in Utrecht! I feel like such a weirdo for being so enthusiastic about bike parking but I'm sure y'all feel similarly.

I'd love hear y'all's favorite spots.

Cheers!
Hello! 

 Any Urban design project ideas for a project that deals with environmental hazards, Climate change, drought, flooding or sea level rise areas ?

Any helpful sources would be much appreciated
 So, I'm sure my type is a dime a dozen—gets interested in sustainable urban design/walkable neighborhoods and suddenly is thinking about a career in the field. I'm a graduate student currently in a fairly unrelated degree in environmental studies, but it's one I've been second guessing. I don't want to be all naïve in thinking I can suddenly make changes in my local area or wherever I would get a job. But I'm curious to hear from people what options there are out there realistically. What jobs do people especially like within this general field that aren't terribly bureaucratic, nor too engineer related (if there are any). What degrees would be recommended for said positions that also wouldn't narrow your options. I have an interest in GIS work so I wonder if there's paths I can take that narrow down on this? Any kind of advice would be helpful, I just want to know if this is an option I should even consider or would I just end up hating it if I even tried.







Background: Im very passionate about urban design, and being a senior in high school I’ve decided it’s the career path I definitely want to pursue. However, being a generally new/recent career (only been around for the past 30-40 years) a degree in urban design is only offered at the masters level. This means I would have to study either a bachelors in architecture (B.Arch) or a bachelors in urban and regional planning (B.URP) first. 

Problem: I have no clue which one to choose, I’m very interested in both topics. I love learning about different vernacular architectural styles, and am very creative and enjoy drawing buildings. I also love learning about the urban fabric, new urbanism, and how best to implement good design in cities to enhance peoples quality of life. 

Question: Which bachelors degree should I study in college? Right now Im stuck in the middle with no preference. Would anyone be able to tell me the differences in what I’d be learning in an architecture program VS. an urban planning one? And which might be best for a future in urban design?



What Kind of websites have up tp date and reliable information on transit ridership in US cities? Specifically state capitals. 

Sorry is this is against the rules but it's worth a shot.













Does anyone know any urban design softwares that are easy to use and are mainly free.(I don't mean free trials). I want to start off with urban design and not have to purchase an entire expensive software when it might not even be my type of thing. I know it sounds like I'm being cheap but I don't want to waste money if I might not even go into that field.


 I say this a software engineer wanting to potentially work in the urban planning field because my city and others like need some all the help they can get. My city is just your typical gold rush created town that was sold to the railroad company.










First two paragraphs are talking about context/intentions. From there on are my questions and concerns.

Hi I’m 19, just entering college this semester while only taking GE courses to make my mind on what to pursue in the future, for both education and career. So I have a semester to figure it out before I go into more preparation classes in community college.

Urban Planning is at the top of my list for careers to pursue. I love the idea of a profession that is designing oriented while also improving the living conditions of communities. Really anything that positively impacts society will fuel my passion to design and problem solve for the job I am doing. So in general I wouldn’t mind doing any field in urban design really but there is a couple areas that are interesting to me if I can end up working on it: transportation, environmental change or helping underdeveloped communities. Immigrating to the US (specifically SoCal) from Canada a few years back I noticed the severe lack of public transportation which bothered me as it restrains accessibility and moveability. As well I noticed a stark contrast in underfunded communities that is seeming ignored compared to other surrounding areas. Also in general the aspect of a greener future, I see the future of urban design oriented with goal of eco friendliness. So working in areas to develop stuff like that, if at all possible would be pretty cool. 

Now getting to the main questions, what would I have to major or minor or double major and what not (quite frankly I don’t fully understand everything about how college works so i might need more understanding) in order to gain appealing skills to my employers (so basically im asking how to proceed with my bachelors). Then after how to proceed with my masters (I’m assuming the masters is more specified so I’d just be doing urban design as a masters, at least from what I’ve seen).

Additionally to better understand the field. How is your quality of life as a urban designer? I’ll make some questions I feel are important to me. The job outlook. I saw that it’s decent, it’s growing at a regular rate, so hopefully that entails opportunity in the field. Do you find there’s good opportunity growth in the field? If not then why? I’ve seen in some fields like architecture where firms are known for shitting on workers that are lower in the ranks. Is the industry of urban designer cutthroat or competitive at all? I understand that urban designing isn’t the greatest paid profession out there, so if it would be cutthroat then I’d imagine that many people would be struggling in a sense.
Assuming you progress in your career from entry level to senior level. How smoothly did that go for you? I know that obviously the pay grades are different at different levels, so overall were you able to have a comfortable life? Because ideally I’d like to have a decent life while doing a cool job like this. Like higher end of middle class to upper middle class. Does urban design give that life or close? Also depending on your position/pay grade how is your work life balance? For example. Hypothetically if people were to struggle in terms of finances but also having no work life then obviously that’s not ideal. But I don’t think urban design gives a life like that 
so how is your work life balance and is it worth it to you?
And how about going above a senior level position into more managerial positions and beyond. In general, I’d like to aim for the best in anything I’d do. What’s the environment of that like?

Sorry if I’m jumbling all these questions and concerns. I’m just trying to get realistic grasp of this career since I don’t understand it fully, and a a reality check in terms of someone’s pay and how it correlates to their quality of life. I know that a senior level position in LA typically makes 90k-100k. That seems good to me but i know that the cost of living LA is high, so how good is that really?

Thank you anyone who takes the time to help out <3





I often see on urbanists forums and youtubers complain about single family detached houses and suburbs that contain them exclusively. I can understand some complaints about them especially when zoning laws to make them inefficient and wanting to expand other forms of housing but at the same time a lot of neighborhoods are built in this manner because of high demand. I’m not saying if cities loosened zoning restrictions there would be no demand for mixed used houses but there’d clearly still be a market for SFH. So what are we suppose to do then? I know many people being up how people in Europe don’t mind living in mid rise but Europe isn’t America so the comparison is pointless. This is also my same logic with cars. US cities became car focused because americans liked cars so much. This is why cities around the world have to basically punish car users to force them to use alternative means of transportation.





Hey there everyone,

I'm currently on my last year of product design doing my last big project and I wanted to ask my reddit friends for some help.

So I'm designing a device that will be present around the cities somewhere on the sidewalk and will purify the air around it. It will measure around 2000mm x 2000mm in the base and will be about 3500mm tall.

I have been reading about my local city's regulations for urban furniture (which contains blueprints of the models and details of the materials of the ones already in use) and trying to see how similar furniture structures are built so that the object is secure in place. I am specially curious about a public restroom, which uses a prefabricated "monoblock" of concrete and stainless steel AISI 304, and on the outside it is made of sheets of stainless steel. Here's a [link](https://www.madrid.es/UnidadesDescentralizadas/ObrasyEspacios/Publicaciones/Ficheros/mu237b-planos-rev.pdf) to the document.

Now, here is an image of my design.

https://preview.redd.it/uhbpo90ylde91.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=d028af59b760ce3b55eddd4cd0d6a3d443e1abf3

**Things to take into account:**

\- The final design would have gaps between the metal sheets, as it would not be a single surface. This is because if the object is vandalized (bended, broken or whatever), only certain parts of the outer structure have to be replaced. Still, they would not be as big as the ones found on the bathroom, and I would try to only create two different models for the outside.

\- The bright part with a girl on it is local publicity on what is supposed to be a screen. I know, horrible rendering skills, but I guess kind of irrelevant since my main problem is structure-wise.

\- The inside has to be as empty as it can be, since it houses the purifying air mechanism, and will also house the screen system and all that.

**Questions:**

\- What is the best way I can secure this structure to the ground? Do I really need to use concrete?

\- Also, should the structure have the inner walls made of concrete like the bathroom?

\- I was thinking of creating a structure using structural stainless steel square pipes that would sit right behind the outer surface, allowing for an easy installation and removal of the outer sheets. This would make the whole thing lighter and reduce the carbon footprint of the device. Would this be enough to hold the whole structure in place or should I add inner concrete walls to attach this structure to?

I'm kind of lost in this aspect of the design and would really appreciate your help :)

Thank you guys
Im not at all an expert on city design but I have caught wind of the conversation on all the negative aspects of suburbia and how having walkable spaces are more valuable. Lately I realized how bored and hobby-less I am as well as everyone else I was seeing in my suburb. I didn't realize until recently that this was primarily because I live in a suburb! As im sure you all know suburbs require you to have a car to go pretty much anywhere of interest other than maybe a friend's house. Even if you do have a car you are mostly surrounded by nothing but shops and restaurants, an area devoid of anything that actually fosters passions, community, or hobbies.

Suburbs sort of have a merit though, in the way that they (or at least the one I live in...) have space for some nature and quiet places. They also allow people to have yard space for gardening/growing food. With walkable cities I love the idea of having more community, diversity, and local festivities but I feel like they could use space for community/personal gardening and nature.

What are some ways to create a living space that combines the local festiveness and community of walkable cities with the opportunity for nature and quiet spaces of (some) suburbs? Is there already a name for this type of thing? What is it called?

Recently my fiancee and I went to a Dairy Queen in the USA for ice cream. The DQ we went to was on the side of a 5-lane stroad. It was surrounded by a massive blacktop parking lot. In mid-July, this was, predictably, very hot. There was no shade. There was no indoor seating. The outdoor seating they did have  was in the form of four tiny, hard, uncomfortable benches facing the parking lot. While sitting outside on the tiny, uncomfortable benches, we were listening to the noise of cars coming and going and breathing in the exhaust fumes of all the cars. We had the hot sun directly in our eyes. I found myself wishing that they had included green space and trees in their lot, instead of just an asphalt ocean. In the end, we chose to leave the benches and eat our ice cream in my fiancee's car, just like everyone else who was there, also eating in their cars.

While we were sitting there, I couldn't help reflecting on the difference in experience between this DQ in the states and the DQ in my hometown, in Canada.

In my hometown, our DQ is placed near a main road, but not directly on it like the American one. The DQ in my hometown is located within a residential area, instead of on a commercial-only stroad. It is surrounded mostly by homes but there are a few other restaurants. It is down the street from a high school in one direction and a middle school in the other direction, so people can stop and get ice cream with their kids after school lets out. It is across the road from a bus stop. There is a small parking lot, multiple bike racks, and wide sidewalks leading to it, so people can arrive how they wish. The DQ in my hometown has ample seating, both inside and outside. They have a full dining room with air conditioning inside, and outside they have a fenced patio with picnic tables, and there are trees and awnings to provide shade. There is a drive through option as well as a walk-in option, so people who want to pick up their ice cream by car and go are separated from the people who arrive by foot or bike. 

At the American DQ next to a busy stroad, my fiancee and I sat outside it in the sun for only ten minutes before we decided we'd rather just eat in comfortable seating, out of the sun, by moving to her car. At the Canadian DQ nestled in a quiet residential neighborhood, I've gone with my sister and my mom many times. We sit and eat our ice cream together, enjoying our outing as a family practically every time we go.

The differences in experience for these two ice cream shops with identical menus was a startling night-and-day difference, just based on how the shop was designed. These two shops really demonstrated to me in a real way how much more pleasant it is when shops are designed for people, not for cars.

Which business do you think will do a better job of creating repeat customers? I know for sure which business I'd rather visit again.

Thoughts on this?
I have finished my BS in (general) architecture. I have almost no substantial knowledge in urban design. I will be focusing on urban design (of smaller sites, like villages or small European cities) for my masters, and i am nervous for the school year to start and me knowing nothing!! Do you have any suggestions of what I can learn and read during this one month before September to get me warmed up? Any software that will be helpful for me? Any books? 

Also, if I will be doing small scale urban design/planning, will it also be beneficial for me to learn larger scale urban design, or will it be more beneficial to just stick to smaller scale in the beginning?
I'm relatively new to Urban design and urban planning and I've already had an introduction to the term 'car-centric'.

I noticed however, that the term is rather vaguely defined and is kind of a 'buzz word'

I wanted to ask two questions here: 

1. Is 'car centrism' on a gradient (car-free to car-dependent) ?
2. If yes, then what's the sweet spot/ motorization level in your opinion?
There is a project in my home city that has been on the planning calendar for years. It’s an important block in an up and coming neighborhood. The final product of this block could make or break the future of the entire city. 

But I’m terrified that a developer will come in and destroy the potential with the typical BS… mid rise apartments, phoned in public spaces and car centric strip mall mentality. 

I want the block to be a public square of sorts, ripe with green space, residential and commercial centers that aren’t chain stores and parking lots. It really could be a modern European plaza with community gardens and event space.

The city wants to hear from the public… but the problem is the only entities capable of submitting a plan to the city that is actionable and plausible are the same big developers that lack creativity in the first place. ( not all are bad and I’ve seen good things from some)

So my question is… how would an individual or a citizen group even begin to submit a competing design plan that would be considered by the city? I don’t have a formal background in urban planning or design and the thought of starting a plan is overwhelming, but I can’t let this block become a other McMain street hellscape. 


Are there YouTube channels? Or templates? Or a good place to start? 

Thanks for any advice.


I'm slated to go to Cornell for "Urban and Regional Studies" which is basically their planning school, but I was wondering what the difference was between Urban Planning and Urban Design? Does one lead to different career paths? Can I focus a lot on the design aspect or is that more similar to architecture?



I'm keen to get into Urban Design, focussing on placemaking and community engagement. I'm 40 and not interested in a university degree due to time, family and money factors. 

I'm currently a UX and Product designer, and while it's a good job and industry, long term I wish to work less in the digital realm, so I'm starting to weigh up my options to get started now and slowly work my way into it. I've done a number of community engagement and placemaking pieces in my own time, free of charge, because I enjoy it.

I'm wondering if anyone knows of or has ideas on alternative methods to get into Urban Design? Be it apprenticeships, internships, bootcamps etc. 

Or should I look into consulting using my digital design skills to network with urban designers?

For context, I'm in Australia and from my research it seems the only real advertised option and industry standard is a university degree. (Happy to be proven wrong here)

Any thoughts?
















Hey y'all!

I am the Associate City Planner for an up-and-coming city in northern MS. I went into the urban planning field because I thought I would actually be designing cities. Turns out, that's more urban design than planning (at least from what I have gathered).

Backstory: When I went to get my MCRP in 2019 (graduated in 2021), there were classes in the CRP program that appeared to be more "design-oriented" including a "design studio", so I figured I would learn about planning principles and policies, as well as the built environment. I also thought I would learn the Adobe suite. The university I was at did not have an Urban Design program and I didn't believe I had the basic technical/computer skills for the Architecture program (I have a BA in Psychology. Super useful).  Turns out, I was wrong. Neither the classes nor the CRP program taught me about city-building/design. Just a lot of laws and theory. Still, I figured I didn't have a reasonable alternative to quitting the program and I figured that my MCRP could eventually lead me to what I want to do: designing cities. I don't love my job, honestly. I write staff reports (dread), create and present PowerPoints at monthly board and commission meetings, etc. Just typical government planner stuff. It is so incredibly boring and is stuck in the Stone Age (our IT department is terrible).   Not exactly what I want out my career and definitely not what I was thinking I would be going to school for.

All of that to say, I have some questions for y'all lol:

1. What types of jobs can I look for with my degree/experience that are more design-oriented, but where I don't have to go back to school? 
2. What skills do I need to have for an urban design career, given that I already have a career/education in planning? What skills do I need to know before I start applying for jobs vs. what can I learn on the job? What is expected?
3. Are there things I can do on my own that I don't need to go back to school for (learning Adobe suite at my own pace, reading books, etc.) that could help me get a job? Please list any resources.
4. If need to go back to school, what is the best route I should take (online, 1 or 2 year program, etc)? Any good programs?
5. Any other tips?

Any advice or resources is greatly appreciate. Y'all are the best. Thanks!



This kinda relates to my last question but it seems like so many urbanists are socialists and again hold this idea that dense and transit development makes countries egalitarian paradises. Ecogecko has admitted to being a socialist before and even though other channels like NJB and CityBeautiful may or may not be socialist they sure use a lot of socialist rhetoric like about equity and inequality. Why is there such a bizarre link?











This sub and other urbanists youtubers like NJB and Ecogecko act like european style cities means everyone lives in harmony, there’s no poverty and the few rich people love poor people living side by side and racism doesn’t exist. Why do people promote this idea about urbanism? Like the Netherlands is awful for poor people yet according to NJB there are zero poor or homeless and the seven rich people live next to them





Why don’t local governments start requiring female trees to be planted around cities so that pollen isn’t bad for everyone, and it could provide jobs to people to either pick fruit, or maintain the trees/clean up after them? But also provide potentially free local fruit!
Why do people act like cities before the 1940s are perfect and had no problems are issues and that cities should never change and should always use old technology like bringing back trolleys because they're perfect?



**Hi** , I am a student at the **Politecnico di Milano** and I am doing research on **air quality for a thesis project**.

I am putting a link to a **quick survey on air quality and micro-mobility** that will be useful for my research

LINK: [https://forms.gle/JsozZaWoN7bRVQVH8](https://forms.gle/JsozZaWoN7bRVQVH8)

I welcome responses from everyone but it would be nice to get some from **cyclists and bike commuters** 

[Air Quality and Micromobility ](https://preview.redd.it/w5peny6tpi891.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=285ff07ca6bcf371c0d5ffa104fdd073ac0fe24f)




R1 bans anything but single family, detached houses, the least efficient use of space.  It inevitably causes car dependence and congestion. 

Higher density building like apartment buildings, townhouses, duplexes, quadriplexes, condominiums, etc.  Especially mixed use development, so you don't need to drive through traffic lights to buy something as mundane a bottle of laundry detergent.










Say you owned entirely or owned a unit in and managed entirely a fancy ornate residential skyscraper on a plot of land that is large relative to the base of the skyscraper, and decided to lease/sell out all units there except for one of the penthouse units as you want that to be your primary residence. When you first bought the rectangular plot of land (that either had a dilapidated low-rise building or was already empty) in the city center, all 4 sides had ample open space surrounding it, with 3 directly opening into a public right-of-way (government-owned land intended to permanently be open to everyone in the general public).

The remaining one, which is a very long side, directly abuts the neighboring plot's garden, which the owner of the sole building there (which is mixed-use and low-rise) has decided decades ago to open to the general public to enjoy for free out of goodwill, even though they (people not on lease or purchase agreements) do not actually have the legal right to be there. The three sides that open up directly to the street public right-of-way have lackluster views from any height, while the side that faces the neighbor's garden has wonderful views of the water and/or mountains/hills once you clear the roof of the low-rise on the neighboring lot.

Since that metropolitan area has a relatively small population, is nowhere close to having a shortage of property, and the specific city center is relatively low-density (like main street in a typical historic town), you determine that it is almost impossible that the neighboring building will be expanded significantly. So, you decide to build a luxurious ornate high-rise residential building there. There are no height restrictions and setback requirements there. However, due to forseeable demand being only moderate, building significantly larger than forecasted would mean significant losses in revenue. Since you want to give all of the forecasted amount of residents the most comfortable and most enjoyable living experience, you decide to set back as far as possible from the street, especially from the one on the long side and place your building right up against the edge of the quiet neighboring garden on the property line shared between you and its owner. You decide to make that side the primary window side because of the views, so all of the upscale units are placed there.

One day, after you and all the other long-term residents have lived many years in and fully comfortably settled down in your respective units, the neighboring lot owner suddenly wants to redevelop his low-rise building that is in good condition. He did that after seeing the success of your building and wants the same success too. Despite the demand not increasing over the years, he still decides to make his new building the same size as yours. Since he also wants all of his residents to be as comfortable and enjoyable as possible, he also decides to set back as far as possible from all street right-of-ways. He also likes the city/town to have as beautiful and enjoyable as an architectural/town planning experience from the public outdoor areas as possible. So, he decides to make his building somewhat like a twin of yours in order to complement it, with very similar architectural styles. Your building is also unproportional from it being too long in relation to its width, so he would like to correct the problem. He solves it by mating his building right up against yours during construction, making both of your buildings permanently bonded together (which is allowed there due to the lack of setback requirements), making the combination look somewhat like its a single building that is wider, and hence proportional. The residents in all of the upscale units in your building (one being yourself) each lose all windows (which made up 40% of all windows in the building before the windows were permanently sealed off) due to your units only having an exterior exposure on that side. That makes all of those units totally devoid of windows. You all suddenly went from having magnificent world-class top-quality views to total darkness in the absense of artificial light practically in the blink of an eye.
However, the developer of the new building next door, who also owns the penthouse unit (also right against the shared property line and at the same height as yours) that is his primary residence there, is extremely friendly and caring, as evidenced by him wanting to fix the unproportional architectural problem and have his residents as comforted and relaxed as possible. He did not build his building right against yours just because he was inconsiderate or because he wanted to block your windows. He was actually quite aware of the problem it would cause. He only did that because he thinks the greater good for the general public way outweighs the negative impacts to individuals (even if they're next-door neighbors, including the next-door landlord (you) specifically) in this case.

How would would you feel about your living situation, your next-door building's landlord, the neighbors in your building, etc. then? Also, since he is so friendly, he will allow you to make a permanent opening through you guys' set of adjoining lot-line walls in order to sort of combine your two separate units into one in order to give you top-convenient access to him at any time for in-person, face-to-face socialization and counseling as part of the way for him to show sympathy and empathy to you, and as a way for him to show sincere effort in trying to compensate for your losses. Would you be willing to cut an opening into the dividing walls in order to join/unite your units together? Would you then totally forgive him?





















Hi everyone! I’m seeking advice as someone looking towards applying to grad school in urban design/planning next year but is also very unhappy in my current position. I work at a nonprofit research organization (that does work with urbanism generally) and am wondering if it would be a detriment to my application to grad school if I took up a position at a local bookstore full time until next year. For context, I’ve been at my current position for almost 2 years. Please let me know if you need anymore info to give advice! Anything would be massively appreciated.

What makes good public transportation; and with the criteria you give what American cities have the best?



Those who have been in both the public and private sector as urban planners or designers, what are the main differences? Do you like one or the other better?

I’ve only been private sector as a consultant but have been considering the switch to public - working for a city, county, etc. Consultant work is really kind of burning me out. Any thoughts?

Thanks!
Hello urban designers! I just started my first post grad job, not specifically urban design but urban planning and gis. I'm wondering if anyone has any helpful resources/image they have on their desk that they reference for anything related to color schemes, general helpful design tips to keep in mind? I thought about finding a color wheel to pin up, but would appreciate any ideas! My desk is boring so I'm trying to make it more colorful and helpful :)



I'm a data analyst and I've been working in tech for a while. I'm currently exploring different career choices and I'm looking for projects at the intersections of what I'm good at (data) and what I'm interested in : sustainability, urban design, architecture, ...

I don't really know where to start so I'm curious to hear from the collective intelligence of Reddit if you know any interesting projects/start-ups in this field ? I'm based in the London, UK, so ideally I'll focus on this area, but happy to hear about projects from elsewhere out of curiosity too.

Thank you !
Hi everybody,


How do we perceive the environment around us? And what does it do to us? I would like to explore these questions in this short survey (about 15 minutes) as part of my master's thesis.


Help me to better understand aesthetics in urban planning!


You can access the survey via this link (available in ENG, DE, and ESP!)

 Thank you very much!!
 Good morning,

We are researchers from the University of Groningen and study Environmental and Infrastructure Planning. We are conducting a study on Reconstruction of European Cities and how successful they were. Due to the long distance and limited time, we are forced to collect our data online. The survey will take a maximum of 5 minutes and it's a part of broader data collection. We would be very grateful if you would complete this survey. Of course, all data is processed securely and anonymously. Thank you in advance for your cooperation!

Guten Tag,

Wir sind Forscher\*innen der Universität Groningen und studieren Umwelt- und Infrastrukturplanung. Wir führen eine Studie über den Wiederaufbau europäischer Städte und ihren Erfolg durch. Aufgrund der geographischen Distanz und der begrenzten Zeit sind wir gezwungen, unsere Daten online zu erheben. Die Umfrage dauert maximal 5 Minuten und ist Teil einer umfassenderen Datenerhebung. Wir wären Ihnen sehr dankbar, wenn Sie an dieser Umfrage teilnehmen würden. Selbstverständlich werden alle Daten sicher und anonym verarbeitet. Vielen Dank für Ihre Teilnahme!

Hi, 

I’m an undergraduate civil engineering student and I have an urban infrastructure internship in the coming weeks. 

I have been told the company uses AutoCAD and it would be beneficial to get to grips with it. 

Is there any areas of AutoCAD I should really focus my learning on + any tips and advice would be welcome. 

Thank you!


Hey, All;

Maybe a goofy question but I'm looking for some classes or tutorials on redesigning street images using Photoshop or a similar program that revolve around a more human centric design.

I'm a mechanical engineer that has loads of solidworks experience and an average Photoshop background (more basic, artistic stuff and less functional design). Is there a better software option for tasks like that that I'm unaware of?

So really anything that would help with perspective alteration or things of that nature would be appreciated.
A burnt out structural engineer here! I would love to pivot my career into helping solve the problems I am passionate about and participate in creating spaces like the ones I loved experiencing in other countries. Not until recently did I realize that would mean a career move into urban design. I have 8 years of experience in civil engineering, most of it structural and at an architecture firm, as well as some graduate research (let's just say in very creative architecture) and studies. I even was a transportation engineer for 2 years designing roadways. I have 3D and 2D modeling skills as well as project management and document production.

&#x200B;

Would it be a stretch for me to make this transition as is? Should I invest in a Masters degree for urban design? Would any professional let me shadow you for a day?? Advice or thoughts on next steps would be greatly appreciated, as I am burnt out from working so hard on things that may not be making things better (and in some cases worse) and a puppet to old engineering ways... Thanks!

Hi! I'm hoping someone here might be able to help me with this. I'm working on a response to a municipal GHG inventory for a US city of \~50k and we are trying to calculate how different investments that could be made would affect GHG emissions. This is easy to do when looking at EV purchases, but much harder when evaluating the effects of efforts to increase transit ridership or build out bike/ped infrastructure. 

Has anyone seen any data correlating investment in non-car infra to reduced vehicle miles traveled or some other useful metric?








I was sitting in a Walmart parking lot the other day wondering how efficient their parking lots are designed. I know that a there must be a thousand situational variables that must be given into consideration. But, given an ideal plot of land on, say, an intersection corner in an ideal situation, what is the most efficient way to design a parking lot?

Hello,

I am an 18 year old senior in high school. For one of my final grades, we get to present about a social issue effecting our community, and the best presentation will receive help getting to present at a town hall. 

For my project, I am planning on doing a photography series along with a speech. I want pictures taken from regular people in their neighborhoods. I would absolutely LOVE if anyone would like to submit any pictures that I could use. I'm focusing on photographing the vast waste of land and the ugliness of my car dependent neighborhood, however it would also be extremely useful if anyone in a nice walkable neighborhood could also submit pictures! I think having photos taken by regular people just walking/driving/etc through their cities could really highlight what it's like from the perspective of a regular person. 

If you would like to provide a small anecdote on how your city's design/planning has effected your life, that would also be helpful, however not at all required! [Here's a link to my pictures I captured on a half hour drive to the grocery store. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y3YvpsO)
I'm asking to see if it is in the shortage occupations list for skilled worker visa in UK.

It seems like Urban design could be in **2431:** ARCHITECTS or **2432:** TOWN PLANNING OFFICERS category.

I know what gentrification is, but there is rhetoric from nimbies that developing a city and attacking car dependency will cause gentrification and hurt minority communities. I know this isn't true, but I don't know why. I am obviously against gentrification, especially in cases where it clearly doesn't even have any benefit such as the case of West End in Boston, but nimbies employ this rhetoric dishonestly so what is the best response to it?





Imo, I feel like they could be useful when trying to combat car dependency. It just makes sense: it takes all the space being taken by parking lots spreading out and makes it go up instead, freeing up space to build literally anything else. I'm no city planner though, I want to know the thoughts of other urban design nerds. If I'm right that they're generally good, why aren't they more common?
Let's say you had a city that was designed in the worst way possible. I'm talking R-1 everywhere and separated from commercial areas by miles of road with no public transport. Strip malls of course, and the neighborhoods are all HOA suburbs. Traffic is, of course, literal hell despite the roads having more than 2 lanes.  So basically an average American city.

The situation is quite dire.

Could this city be saved? If so what is a step by step effective way of saving such a city? How could this city become walkable?

Hi, so I received an unofficial offer for the Urban Design MArch at UCL. Since the program is too expensive, I was wondering about my chances of getting a job (in Uk) in urban design after graduation to pay off the loan. I've also received offers from TUDelft, Sheffield, Edinburgh, and Newcastle for similar courses. Should I just accept a more affordable program or stick with UCL? Do the universities matter when searching for a job?

Any advice/suggestions are welcome.

I think balconied are a nice feature in apartments and condos. But I rarely ever see them being used. (Hanging Landry on them doesn’t count). Why do you think this is and can anything be done about it?






Im in a smart city competition this weekend. The challenge ist to create solutions for making a city "smarter". We are supposed to use sensor technic. It doesn't really matter what specific part of the city gets better. So any ideas? My only idea so far, the traffic light system from the Netherlands.


Using the San Francisco peninsula area as an example, a lot of the opposition from development of higher density housing in traditionally lower density areas is that taller buildings would ‘ruin the character’ of the neighborhoods through differences in aesthetics.

And, credit where it’s due, it’s easy to see where they’re coming from. There’s few things as visually jarring as seeing a modern chic apartment tower sticking out from 50’s era low slung housing like a sore, plastic-looking thumb. But sooner or later, one has to concede that the need for denser housing in these communities is there, and must be addressed.

So are there ways of designing multistory housing and commercial buildings so that they ‘fit’ visually with the likes of San Fran’s famous Painted Ladies rowhouses, or the Seinfeld-ish brownstone dwellings of older cities elsewhere? Obviously adjusting building codes so that denser areas ‘blend’ into the neighboring neighborhoods through gradual increase/decrease in height is one option, but I’m also asking in terms of overall style.

Would it help any to see a revitalizing of older building aesthetics for buildings over 5 stories? Maybe a return to Gilded Age neo-gothic, or maybe the eloquent styling seen on NYC’s Singer Building?

Please, discuss. Or school me like the dumbass I probably am, whichever.
















Hi all,

I'm looking for grad programs that focus on Latin American cities through an urban design, studies, planning and/or development lens. Does anyone know of schools that have programs that focus on this? Or faculty? 

I would love the opportunity to study abroad too, so any grad programs that have the option to study abroad in Latin America would be great too!

Thanks!










How can streets, and the buildings/amenities on them, be designed to promote pedestrian vibrancy in the winter? 

For example, Ottawa (Canada’s capital) the cold season lasts for 3.3 months, from December 3 to March 11, with an average daily high temperature below 1 °C. The coldest month of the year in Ottawa is January, with an average low of -14 °C and high of -5 °C.


Hi all, I am looking at getting a masters in urban planning, but of course, I first need to get a bachelors in something. The standard options are economics, PolSci, geography, etc. I however was looking at getting a civil engineering degree somewhere like UofM CEE. Is CivEng related enough to where I could get a masters in urban planning? Is it a good option at all? Should I just stick with Landscape Architecture or Economics?

I live in a \~150 year old part of town. There's a *road* that cuts through the two major neighborhoods in the area. Both sides of the road are densely populated with businesses. There are good side walks and street parking, but no bike lanes and few crosswalks.

The relevant stretch of this road is five \~220 foot blocks. The road is two lanes each direction with a center turn lane. The lanes are 10 feet wide. Street parking is allowed on the outermost lanes during off-peak hours, so during the day and evening it's really one lane each way with a center turn lane.

The road is a major east-west artery for this part of town. The latest numbers I can find show 18,000 vehicles a day on this stretch of the road.

The road is pretty annoying for the residents of the area because crossing the road essentially requires walking to one of the ends.

I'm trying to come up with a good design for this road for the very slim chance that someone in the city listens to me. It's just a struggle because the road is a major-ish artery but also has a lot of pedestrian demand.

What I would *love* to see is to turn this road into a two lane road with a center turn lane, permanent street-side parking on each side protecting a bike lane, and more crosswalks. But I don't know if that many lanes can support the traffic. Granted *some* traffic would reduce as people in the area would be able to walk or bike to the businesses instead of drive.

I'm hoping to get some thoughts from you all about how you might approach this kind of situation. Thanks!
Is the international urban planning community near unanimous on the view that single-use zoning, urban sprawl, non-walkable cities are bad? Or is the urban planning community more like the economics community, where there are a lot of conflicting views and opposing viewpoints?

Single-use zoning = bad, mixed-use zoning = good

Urban sprawl/surburbia = bad

Automobile-focused = bad, walkable/public transportation-focused = good

Smart growth = good?



I've been thinking about picking up a book or two about urban design/urbanism, something intertwined with behavioural science or psychology, specifically about European cities. Any recommendations?

 

Hello all,

I  live in Candler Park which is on the east side of Atlanta. Recently a  group of people in the neighborhood and with some support from our  Neighborhood Organization have begun to organize to try and have the  neighborhood designated as a historic district. It is in the early  stages, but all indications seem to be that the goal is to do everything  to prevent allowing small older homes to be turned into larger homes or  duplexes. It is my hope that people see we should not be trying to  outlaw more density and stop the designation, or ideally use this  process to actually encourage more affordable housing to be built in the  area. The anti density goals of this group seem to be very popular  amongst my neighbors so any advice on arguments or strategies to oppose  this movement would be greatly appreciated. Here is the link to the  historic districts planning committee website if anyone is interested:

I'm a master student in interiorarchitecture and for one project I need, as the title states, a map of my area. Since this is a scale I have never worked in before, but the study is trying to challenge us, I feel a bit at loss how to approach this. I asked my professors but they directed me to google maps. I want a map in A0 with the focus on topographic heights and water bodies (river/lake).

I know snazzymaps, open street search, michelin maps but none of those are working out for me. Ideally the map retains vector qualities so I can adjust the info I want to keep and dismiss all excess.

I downloaded QGis but have no idea how to put it for good use.

Will highly appreciate any advice or directory!
I just recently accepted my first job as an assistant planner in a mid-sized city in Pennsylvania, and one thing I immediately realized is that a lot of the public we work with are Spanish speakers. As a smaller city, we don't have a lot of resources or staffing that is inclusive for those who don't know English very well (all of our documents are in English, and no one else in our department speaks Spanish). I know basic Spanish, so I can roughly help them along with the aid of Google Translate, but I really would like to be more welcoming and helpful to our Spanish speaking community.

Does anyone have any advice or resources for a situation like this? Even if anyone has links to a Zoning and Planning terminology list in Spanish, that would be great! Ideally, I would like to work to create copies of all of our documents in other languages, but I am not sure the best way to approach this. I'd appreciate any and all help!
